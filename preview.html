      <p class="lead">The <strong>2023 Festival of Historic Houses Preview Party</strong> is hosted by Cathy Lund and Peter Karczmar at their stunning home at 225 Adelaide Avenue, the John S. Tripp, Jr. House.</p>

      <p>Constructed in 1878, the Tripp House was the first of the large houses to appear along Adelaide Avenue. John Tripp Jr. was an import tailor, whose shop was located downtown at 54 Westminster Street. Built at a time when Elmwood was becoming increasingly accessible to the central business district, Tripp would have commuted via the Elmwood Avenue trolley line to his shop downtown. This connectivity made Elmwood Providence’s first “streetcar suburb.”</p>
      <p>The Tripp House is a handsome Second Empire-style building with a quintessential mansard roof, and the semi-octagonal turret with its engaged chimney was likely an addition by a later owner. Tripp lived here for only three short years before it was sold to cotton dealer Benjamin Vaughan, in 1881.</p>
      <p>Tickets are $150 per person and <strong>include admission to Saturday’s self-guided tours</strong>.</p>
