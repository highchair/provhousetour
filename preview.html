        <p class="lead">A Festival Preview Party will be held on the evening of Thursday, June 13 at Lincoln School's 1870 Margarethe Dwight House, a large Second Empire home built in 1870 for Christopher A. Pierce. </p>
        <p>In 1883, the architectural firm of Stone, Carpenter &amp; Willson renovated the property in keeping with the style of the time. The property was purchased by the Lincoln School in 1943 and re-named in honor of the daughter of the school’s founder. </p>
        <p>Guests will enjoy live music, heavy hors d’oeuvres, full bar, and a luxury raffle. </p>
        <p>Your Preview Party ticket includes admission to Saturday’s house tours. Proceeds go toward PPS’s citywide preservation advocacy.</p>
