      <p class="lead">Exclusive Festival preview party at the 1904 Sarah T. Harrison House, hosted by Ann Laquerre
        and David Franklin. 6 – 8 pm</p>
      <p><img class="img--rwd" src="{% link assets/img/103-lloyd-preview-party.jpg %}" alt="" /></p>
      <p>Located at 103 Lloyd Avenue, the Sarah T. Harrison House was designed by local architects Howard K. Hilton and F. Ellis Jackson and built in 1904. The firm Hilton & Jackson designed many Colonial Revival homes in Providence, like this fine example which was completed the year before Jackson took a leave of absence to study at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris.</p>
      <p>Character-defining features of the Harrison House include the double bowfronts flanking the front door and the connected pedimented dormers. This house is a contributing property to the College Hill Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places. Guests will enjoy heavy hors d’oeuvres, a full bar, and a chance to explore all this beautiful historic home has to offer.</p>
      <p>Tickets are $150 per person and include admission to Saturday’s self-guided tours.</p>
