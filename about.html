        <p class="lead">With twenty-five official neighborhoods and countless historic homes, cultural landscapes, and private gardens, Providence is bursting with places to explore. </p>
        <p>Since 1980, PPS has produced the Festival of Historic Houses as a way to get to know the streets and homes that you won’t necessarily find in any guidebook. Each year, the Festival highlights the architecture and history of one of Providence’s historic neighborhoods, drawing hundreds of people from near and far.</p>
          <p>This year, we will explore the crest of College Hill and feature homes on Keene Street and Lloyd Avenue, part of the tree-lined neighborhoods north of Brown University between Angell and Olney Streets. This area represents a period of economic growth and diversification of architectural styles in Providence’s history. The earliest houses appeared closest to Prospect Street in the 1850s, and by the 1870s, ample <a href="http://guide.ppsri.org/property/william-f-sayles- house" target="_blank" title="Open link in a new window">Second Empire</a> and <a href="http://guide.ppsri.org/property/henry-a-dike-house" target="_blank" title="Open link in a new window">Italianate</a> houses dotted the neighborhood. The building boom of the 1880s and 1890s saw a blend of <a href="http://guide.ppsri.org/property/stephen-a-cooke-house" target="_blank" title="Open link in a new window">Queen Anne</a> and <a href="http://guide.ppsri.org/property/stephen-o-metcalf-house" target="_blank" title="Open link in a new window">Colonial Revival</a> houses, all comfortable in size, rich in detail, and set back from the streets to allow for dense landscaping.</p>
          <p>Its proximity to Brown University and Rhode Island School of Design attracted professors to this burgeoning enclave. Historically, residents of Keene Street and Lloyd Avenue were professionals — business and tradesmen who worked downtown, or in management at one of Providence’s numerous factories.</p>
            <p>Today, the neighborhood is known for its impressive array of carefully maintained and preserved houses. Trees shade the street and the parcels are handsomely landscaped, creating an oasis within the urban fabric. In planning this year’s Festival, we’ve heard more than one confession that this area is a Providence favorite, and we’re excited to invite you in to the homes that lend this historic district its magic.</p>
