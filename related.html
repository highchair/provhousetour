        <h2><a href="http://www.doorsopenri.org/janeswalk" target="_blank" title="Open link in new window">Jane’s Walk Weekend</a></h2>
        <p><b>May 1–3, FREE</b></p>
        <p>Kick off National Preservation Month by getting to know some of Providence’s hidden treasures. This global festival is inspired by urban activist Jane Jacobs and takes place in over 200 cities during the first weekend in May. Unlike most guided tours, these free walking conversations are led by volunteer citizen guides who share knowledge of their own communities while inspiring participants to think, talk, and connect.</p>
        
        <h2>Marker Meet-up</h2>
        <p><b>May 14, 5:30 pm, FREE</b></p>
        <p>PPS has publicly recognized over 1,500 buildings and property owners through its Historic Marker Program, and if we’ve learned anything, it’s that Providence’s historic buildings and the people who love them are endlessly interesting. Have a maker on your house already? Come mix and mingle and share the remarkable history of your home.</p>
        <p>Want to know more about this longstanding program? We’ll be available to answer your questions and share information about the city’s awesome architecture.</p>
