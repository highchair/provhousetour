house-description: 'In its 125 years of existence, the house at 58 Keene has experienced a rather complex history. It was built for Harriet L. Bucklin, a retired, unmarried schoolteacher, who purchased the lot in July 1897. Permits were pulled soon after for its construction. Upon its completion, Bucklin resided here with another unmarried woman, Susan C. Sawyer, as well as a widowed nurse from Canada, Isabella McArthur, and a young Irish servant named Delia Kelley.  


Bucklin’s ancestral roots are well documented. Her mother, Lydia Barnaby Simmons, was a descendant of Thomas Durfee of Portsmouth, Rhode Island – Durfee settled there in the 1660s, becoming constable. From that original settlement of the Durfee family came future extensions into the city of Fall River, Massachusetts, where the Durfee name is synonymous with its historic mills and landmark high school. Harriet’s father, George, was a descendant of Joseph Bucklin, who settled in an area of Rehoboth, Massachusetts, that is now part of Pawtucket, Rhode Island. A later descendant of the first Joseph Bucklin, also named Joseph, fired the shot that wounded the captain of the British ship HMS Gaspee, which was boarded and burned by group of colonists from Providence on June 10, 1772, a major event in the lead-up to the American Revolution.  


Harriet died in December 1901, and by 1902 the house was listed for lease. Lawyer Livingston Ham resided here starting in 1903. By 1909, Nelson H. Benson and his family took up residence. In the 1910 U.S. Census, Benson did not list an occupation other than “own income,” but resided here with his wife Mary, two daughters, and a Black servant from Massachusetts named Lucille Wallace.  


The period of 1930-1949 saw the greatest change to this property. By 1930, the house was owned by electrical engineer Edmund S. Parsons. He lived here with his wife Mary, their five children, and two servants: Ruguhild Frederickson, a 30-year-old woman from Norway, and Margaret McLaughlin, a 28-year-old woman from Massachusetts. The Parsons relocated to Warwick in 1935 and rented the house to the family of Malcolm Doyle Champlin. Champlin was an attorney and Seventh-District judge. His wife was the former Catherine Makepeace, and together they had three children: Patricia (“Poppie”), Malcolm Doyle, and Thomas Arthur Doyle. In the early morning hours of December 28, 1939, Mrs. Champlin was awakened by the sound of crackling. She saw orange reflected in the windows of her neighbor’s house across Keene Street and immediately woke her husband and children. Their rooms filled with smoke, and flames rose from the basement up through the east side of the house. All escaped unharmed, but the structure was greatly damaged. On March 10, 1940, less than three months after the fire, Edmund Parsons pulled permits to remodel the house into a two-family dwelling.  


With the alteration into a two-family residence in 1940, a new address, 56-58 Keene, became effective, and the interior layout changed greatly. An entrance was added to the west side of the residence, allowing access to the second-floor apartment, #56. This entrance retains the original staircase. An original piazza on the front façade provided access to the entrance to the first-floor apartment, #58. The home’s use as a two-family was short-lived, however, for in 1949 permits were pulled by George E. Ladd to convert the structure back into a single-family residence. At this time, the front entrance and piazza were replaced with a simple oriel bay window that remains to this day. The side entrance remained, but the address was changed to 58 Keene Street.  


Today, the homeowners have made as much progress as possible to blend the numerous alterations together. Doorways have been heightened and enhanced with transoms throughout the ground floor. A rear room was converted into a den with a gas fireplace and access to a covered porch. The kitchen was completely remodeled in 2004. It had been a kosher kitchen for its previous owner. The home is filled with cherished antiques passed down to the owners from their relatives, with wonderful and fascinating stories to accompany them. '
