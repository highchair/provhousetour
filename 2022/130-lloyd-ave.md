house-title: 130 Lloyd Avenue
house-name: Julius H. Preston House
house-detail: '<i>1905-1906, B.S.D. Martin architect</i><br>Owners: Catherine and Rob Taylor'
house-description: 'Produce dealer Julius Preston and his wife Elizabeth constructed their handsome brick Colonial Revival on Lots 37, 38, and 39 of the Halsey Estate Plat in 1905. The couple hired architect B.S.D. Martin to design their house. Little is known about the architect, but Martin had studied at McGill University in Toronto, and later furthered his studies in Paris.  


Martin’s design is an imposing, modern adaptation of a late-18th century Georgian house. The asymmetrical façade is anchored by an entrance portico with Doric columns and elaborate balustrades. A belt course delineates the perimeter of the structure between the two principal floors. The steeply pitched gambrel roof covered in slate is supported by an intricate dentil and modillion cornice. On the east side of the house is a sun porch with a double-height rounded bay window.   


Julius Preston owned J & H Preston & Company, a wholesaler of foreign and domestic fruits and produce with an office at 13 Dyer Street. He and his wife lived at 130 Lloyd with their two sons and two daughters, as well as three servants: Margaret Gormley of Rhode Island, Mary Griffin of Ireland, and Catherine McCarthy of Ireland.  


The house has changed hands very few times. After Julius’s death in 1920, Elizabeth lived at 130 Lloyd until 1961. The house was sold to John Barrett and his wife Mary, and they lived at the house until 1985, when it transferred to their son John Barrett Jr. The current homeowners have lived here since 2001.'
