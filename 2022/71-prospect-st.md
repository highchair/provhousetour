The Church is open for touring, with a performance by organist Richard Spicer from 10 am - noon


With its prominent copper dome dominating the East Side skyline, First Church of Christ, Scientist, Providence has stood as both a religious and architectural landmark atop College Hill since its completion in 1913. To design their church, the group of Christian Scientists chose Howard Hoppin, who was from a notable Providence family of artists and physicians. He and his brother, Francis L.V., started an architecture firm in the 1890s before going their separate ways. Early on, Howard had a talent for designing small churches. By 1907, he brought on Frederick Field to create the firm of Hoppin & Field.


Based on 16th-century Italian ecclesiastical architecture, the design for First Church of Christ, Scientist, Providence also beckons toward the headquarters of this denomination, located on Huntington and Massachusetts Avenues in Boston (designed by Brigham & Beman, 1903-1906). A large entrance hall on the ground floor provides access to twin staircases to the north and south that lead to the worship space. Colossal Corinthian columns define the perimeter of the auditorium, and a third-story balcony provides additional seating. Above is a shallow saucer dome with leaded translucent glass.


Christian Scientists in Providence began to hold informal services in 1889 and received a charter from the state legislature in 1895. Their first building, at 250 Bowen Street, was used until the completion of the current church.'
