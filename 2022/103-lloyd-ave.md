house-name: Sarah T. Harrison House
house-detail: '<i>1904, Hilton & Jackson architects</i><br>Owners: Ann Laquerre and David Franklin'
house-description: 'Constructed on lots 70 and 71 of the Halsey Estate Plat, the house at 103 Lloyd Avenue was built for Sarah T. Harrison in 1904. She acquired the lots on May 2, 1904, and an intention to build was filed two days later. Sarah was married to chemical manufacturer Alfred Harrison, and they resided with their children at 260 Olney Street. Over the course of the Harrison’s ownership of 103 Lloyd, the couple never lived at the house, but instead invited their daughter, Lillian, and her husband, Frederick Potter, to reside there.  


The Harrisons selected the firm of Hilton & Jackson to design the house. Architect Howard Hilton was a nearby neighbor, living at 193 Brown Street, whose firm was founded in 1902 when Hilton took on architect F. Ellis Jackson. The pair focused their designs to reflect the early colonial architecture of Rhode Island while incorporating the newest concepts and trends in residential design. A year after the completion of 103 Lloyd, Jackson took a leave of absence to study at the prestigious École des Beaux-Arts (School of Fine Arts) in Paris. This institution produced some of the greatest architects to practice in America, such as Richard Morris Hunt, Charles Follen McKim, and Thomas Hastings. Upon his return in 1909, and after the sudden death of Howard Hilton, Jackson would go on to practice through his subsequent architecture firms. 


At 103 Lloyd, Hilton & Jackson turned to the late-18th and early-19th century Georgian period for their design. The street façade is symmetrical and flush to the sidewalk. A central portico with side steps references the historic houses that line the streets of Providence’s older Benefit Street and Fox Point neighborhoods. The façade features a flanking pair of double-height bow front windows and thick corner pilasters. A deep-bracketed eave supports the hip roof with connecting dormers. The effect is a fresh take on a classic design.  


After 1909, the house was rented out to George L. Gross, an insurance agent. He lived at 103 Lloyd with his wife Maude and three children. The household included three servants: Nellie Greene from Ireland, Julia Rurdan from New York, and Mary O’Neil from Ireland. The Gross family lived at 103 Lloyd until 1928.  


From 1928 until 2018, the house changed hands nearly a dozen times. The current owners, originally from Rhode Island, wanted a home in an urban setting. The previous owners had completed a large refresh, with new light fixtures, wallpaper, refinished floors, and a new Scandinavian-style kitchen. As the house needed little cosmetically, the current owners have taken on the huge project of updating the house’s plumbing system – now a state-of-the-art smart system – as well as painstakingly restoring the house’s original wood windows. Through a window-restoration course hosted by the Providence Preservation Society, the homeowners have restored 29 out of 41 windows. Of particular interest is the owners’ vast collection of modern art, displayed throughout the house.  '
