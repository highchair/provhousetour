house-title: '110 Lloyd Avenue'
house-name: '(Front Garden Only) William H. Phillips House'
house-detail: '<i>1902, unknown builder</i><br>Owners: Sally Barker and Steven Hamburg'
house-description: 'A blend of different styles, notably Shingle, Queen Anne, and Prairie, defines the William Phillips House. Built in 1902, the house was occupied by the Phillips family until 1942. William was the secretary and treasurer of the Providence Washington Insurance Company, with an office at 20 Market Square. The Phillips family included two children, Warren and Annie, and a servant, Sarah Johnson of Virginia.  


The exterior features a variety of materials. The ground floor is brick, with an elaborate porch featuring rounded Doric posts. An unusual triangular-shaped bay window sits adjacent to the entrance. The upper floor is sheathed in painted wood shingles and set within very deep-bracketed eaves. It is a pleasant fusion of materials and styles.  


Like its neighbor at 130 Lloyd, this house has changed hands very few times  â€“ just three since leaving ownership of the Phillips family in 1942. The current owners have lovingly maintained the property and added a welcoming oasis in their front yard. The numerous perennials, including hostas, hydrangeas, and various ornamental grasses, offer a burst of color throughout the seasons. '
