house-name: 'Mary Elizabeth & Henry Dexter Sharpe House'
house-detail: '<i>1921, Parker, Thomas & Rice architects</i><br>Marion Coffin, landscape architect (Garden Only)'
house-description: 'Known as “Rochambeau House” and in use by Brown University’s Department of French Studies and Department of Hispanic Studies, the house was the longtime residence of the Sharpe family. Mrs. Sharpe was closely involved in the design of both the house and its grounds. She desired a house that was as authentic as possible – many interior features were imported from France – and that struck a balance between France’s rural chateaux and sophisticated urban dwellings.


Mrs. Sharpe insisted the house be sited relatively close to the street to maximize the use of the grounds behind the house, which extend through the block to Congdon Street. A large terrace overlooking the back lawn is filled with planting beds and paving, arranged to give the impression of an even larger property. The thoughtful selection of planting material allows the property to be appreciated throughout the year, and the placement of benches extends the living areas outside the house.


Mrs. Sharpe was deeply involved with the landscape throughout the city. She was active in the planting of trees at India Point Park and throughout the Brown University campus. The Sharpe Street Tree Fund, established by the family, is still in use today providing new street trees throughout the city of Providence.'
