house-title: 15-17 Keene Street
house-name: Thomas Breck Double House
house-detail: '<i>1876-1877, unknown builder</i><br>Owner: Rev. Peter Laarman'
house-description: 'In 1850, surveyors Cushing & Farnum measured and platted the property owned by the estate of T. L. Halsey, along the south side of Keene Street. A total of 20 parcels were created on the Halsey Estate Plat. Two lots, 4 and 5, were acquired by Thomas Breck on August 1, 1868. Construction did not commence until 1876. Breck was in the business of manufacturing trunks and traveling bags.


A double house in the Second Empire style was finished in 1877. The structure contains all the characteristics of the style, most notably the mansard roof. A central entrance porch is flanked by bay windows topped with bracketed caps. The house has been faithfully maintained, with many of the historic details intact.


Breck used the property for rental income; however, he soon relocated here in 1880. At the time, the address was 9 Keene, but was changed to 15-17 Keene in 1893. Breck resided at #17 until his death in 1903. The house was sold to Mary L. Clear in 1904, who rented out the two units. In 1920, the property was purchased by Walter Foster Angell, a prominent lawyer. Angell was partner in the firm of Edwards & Angell, founded with fellow Brown University alum Stephen O. Edwards in 1894. The firm most recently merged with the Locke Lord law group.


Following Angellâ€™s death in 1936, the house was sold in 1938 to Brown University. A series of owners continued until 2006, when the double house was converted into condos. An addition at the rear of #17 features a guest bedroom, accessed via a small hallway off the kitchen. The current owner purchased the ground floor unit in 2019. Original details such as the fireplace mantel, ornate trim, and high ceilings remain.  '
