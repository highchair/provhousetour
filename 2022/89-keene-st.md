house-name: Mary P. & William H. Clewley House
house-detail: '<i>1896, unknown builder</i>'
house-description: 'A well-maintained Colonial Revival home, 89 Keene holds an interesting story that ties several of the neighborhood houses together. It was built in 1896 on Lot 20 of the Halsey Estate Plat. The land was acquired by Mary Putnam Clewley for the sum of $10. A day after closing on the sale of the land, Mary filed intentions to build with the city. The estimated cost to build was $5,500. Though no architect is listed, the house is a fine example of the Colonial Revival style, with its shingled exterior, front double-story bay window, east-facing oriel bay window, and deep eaves.  


The ownership of the house by Mary Clewley reflects the legal and economic realities of the era. Mary’s husband, William, was an electrician at the time of the house’s completion. His career, however, was unsettled. Based on city directories, William held jobs as a coal dealer, a jewelry repairman, an electrician, and a chemical engineer. Because of the instability of his professions, it was likely that Mary took ownership of the house to protect them, should his business fail. This was very common among couples who operated their own businesses, as placing the ownership of the house into the wife’s name would protect it from bank possession. At various times under the Clewley’s ownership, they were known to have taken in tenants to rent rooms.   


In the 1900 U.S. Census, the occupants of the house included the Clewleys, Mary’s unmarried sister Abbie Putnam, and William’s aunt Grace Wilbur. The Clewleys had a servant, a Black woman from South Carolina named Minda Coaxsum.  


By December 1907, the Clewleys sold the house to John S. Murdock, a lawyer whose office was located downtown at the Banigan Building on Weybosset Street. He was married to Nettie S. Goodale. Murdock was a Brown University alum, who received his law degree from Harvard in 1899. His legal career began in Providence, eventually becoming partner in the firm of Murdock & Tillinghast in 1911. He later served as the U.S. Attorney for the Seventh District of Rhode Island. In 1912, Murdock transferred ownership of the house to his wife Nettie. Nettie’s widowed mother, Saraphine Goodale, moved in with the couple by 1920. John was appointed to the Rhode Island Supreme Court in 1929 and held that seat until 1935. After his sudden death of a heart attack in 1946, Nettie remained at 89 Keene Street until she sold the house in October 1960.  


The new owners were sisters Elizabeth and Margaret Rose. The Rose sisters, along with their father, were the longest residents at 89 Keene in the house’s history. The current owners acquired the property in 2012. Since then, the only modifications have been to the kitchen, bathrooms, and the house’s mechanics. When restoring the fireplace hearth in the main hall, it was discovered that identical ceramic tiles were being stored in the basement of #58 Keene, and several tiles were brought over to finish the project. Of note, the homeowners engaged designer Warren Leach of Tranquil Lake in Rehoboth, Massachusetts, to landscape the backyard patio and gardens.'
