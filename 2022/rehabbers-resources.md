house-description: 'Maintaining Providence’s thousands of historic homes is a team effort, and we believe everyone and anyone can be a preservationist.


PPS supports the projects being done by homeowners, renters, and community stewards — the kind of work that happens at night and on weekends — with our Rehabbers Resources. Stop by our table at 103 Lloyd Avenue to learn more about how the Sarah T. Harrison House exemplifies some of the challenges historic homeowners face, and how we can connect you to the programs, trainings, and information you might need to tackle your preservation projects. The historic house doctor is in!'
