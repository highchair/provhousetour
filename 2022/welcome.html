  <h1 class="h2">A Message from our Executive Director</h1>
  <p class="lead">Ah, spring! As a Southerner, the most wonderful thing to me about New England is the change of seasons.</p>
    
  <p>This spring is perhaps even more welcome than most after the last two years we have endured. And so we look forward to the return of cherished activities, including the Festival of Historic Houses (and Gardens!). </p>
  
  <p>Welcome to our 40th Festival, presented for the second year in coordination with <a href="//www.gardenconservancy.org" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">The Garden Conservancy</a>. We will be glad to see you and we hope you will make a point to reconnect with old friends and to make new ones, as you explore this city’s hidden gems. The Festival has long given residents and visitors alike the opportunity to unite in celebration of Providence’s indelible design heritage and culture and this year is no different.</p>
   
  <p>We are excited this year to feature a special enclave in the College Hill Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. This desirable neighborhood continues to thrill old house enthusiasts who value proximity to downtown and several institutions of higher learning.</p>
   
  <p>And as with last year, we are following the latest public health guidance. We are returning to guided tours of interior spaces, and <b>facemasks are welcome, but not required</b>.</p>
   
  <p>If you are visiting from out of town, you will find the <a href="http://www.thayerstreetdistrict.com" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">Thayer Street District</a> chock full of eateries and shops just a few blocks from this year’s tour. The <a href="https://www.goprovidence.com" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">GoProvidence</a> website is an invaluable tool if you are looking for a meal or a cocktail, want to do a little shopping, or are interested in learning more about our city’s rich heritage. Providence has a lot to offer.</p>
   
  <p>We’re excited you’re here and hope you enjoy the weekend! If you are interested in supporting this organization in our efforts to promote the preservation and revitalization of Providence, we welcome you to become a member of the <a href="https://ppsri.org/support/membership/" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">Providence Preservation Society</a>. Your support means more advocacy for historic preservation, thoughtful design, and people-centered planning in Providence. And you will get early notice about future events, like next year’s Festival!</p>
   
  <p>Enjoy the tour!<br>
