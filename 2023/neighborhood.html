  <h1 class="h2">Neighborhood History</h1>
  <p class="lead">The place we know today as Elmwood has a history shaped by its proximity to the center of Providence – close enough to benefit from the services, amenities, and workforce of a growing city and distant enough to develop its own character and culture.</p>
  <p>In colonial Providence, the slice of land to the south of the city, between today’s downtown and Roger Williams Park, was rural farmland. The neighborhood takes the name “Elmwood” from Joseph J. Cooke’s farm of the same name. Somewhat removed from the urban center of Providence, Elmwood (together with West Elmwood and South Providence) was annexed by the adjacent town of Cranston as early as 1754. By the 1860s, the political and economic gravity of Providence pulled Elmwood back into the fold, and in 1868, the town boundaries were formally redrawn.</p>
  <p>In the years that followed, the neighborhood boomed. Houses for middle- and upper-class residents began sprouting up along Elmwood Avenue and Broad Street. In between, a network of tree-lined streets filled in with exuberant homes in all the latest architectural styles. In 1890, Gorham Manufacturing Company opened a massive factory nearby on Mashapaug Pond, indelibly changing the economic and cultural character of the neighborhood. With Gorham’s presence in Elmwood, large tracts of factory and tenement housing were built on the blocks north of the factory and Mashapaug Pond near Huntington Avenue.</p>
  <p>A horse-drawn trolley system began operating between Earl Street and Market Square via Elmwood Avenue and Broad Street in 1865. The Union Railroad Company electrified the line in 1893. Streetcars carried passengers from home to work and back again, establishing Elmwood as Providence’s first streetcar suburb. A trolley house at the end of Earl Street connected to the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad passenger line, and this level of connectivity allowed residents to travel around the city and beyond efficiently and comfortably.</p>

  <p>Gorham Manufacturing employed hundreds of workers – including superintendents, designers, and line workers – and drew an influx of new residents to Elmwood. Beyond factory work, records show neighborhood residents working in a variety of professions: as doctors, lawyers, shop owners, office clerks, and schoolteachers. The pleasant suburban character of Elmwood attracted other industrialists and downtown business owners to the neighborhood as well. John McAuslan, the owner of a thriving department store located in the <a href="//guide.ppsri.org/property/callendar-mcauslan-troup-building" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">Callendar, McAuslan, & Troup Building</a> on Westminster Street, commissioned a lavish Queen Anne Revival manse on Elmwood Avenue between Lexington Avenue and Ontario Street.</p>
  <p>Like many communities across the country and within Providence, the rise of car culture changed the physical landscape and social texture of Elmwood. In the post-war period, new roads and highways divided once contiguous, pedestrian neighborhoods. With streetcar ridership at an all-time low, Providence’s trolley network was discontinued by 1948 in favor of passenger buses. Easy transportation, coupled with unequal lending practices that pushed for mortgages and new construction in the suburbs, fueled the exodus of white, middle-class residents and the growth of suburban development in Cranston and Warwick. Large businesses followed suit, relocating from Providence’s urban core to office parks and shopping centers outside the city. The closure of <a href="//artinruins.com/property/gorham-manufacturing-co/" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">Gorham’s landmark factory complex</a> in 1986 hit the Elmwood neighborhood particularly hard.</p>
  <p>Economic decline, an eroding tax base, and municipal disinvestment deeply affected Elmwood. Residents adapted many of the neighborhood’s aging, single-family homes into apartments and boarding houses, and some large houses were simply abandoned. The Providence Redevelopment Authority strategically designated Elmwood as “blighted,” making the neighborhood vulnerable to predatory urban renewal projects. And when the city extended the Huntington Expressway from Olneyville Square to Cranston’s Reservoir Avenue in 1960, an entire neighborhood of West Elmwood was demolished to make way for the highway and an office park.</p>
  <p>Despite dramatic changes throughout the 20th century, Elmwood’s walkability, small businesses, and historic buildings continued to attract new neighbors. In recent decades, Latine and Asian communities have enlivened the neighborhood with markets and restaurants along Elmwood Avenue and Broad Streets. With relatively low property values, the neighborhood has been favored among first-time homebuyers, many of whom restored the Victorian houses for which the neighborhood is known. In 1980, Elmwood was designated a National Register District.</p>
  <p>Local community members formed several agencies to continue revitalizing the neighborhood. Since the 1970s, <b>Stop Wasting Abandoned Properties</b> (known as <span class="abbr">SWAP</span>) has focused on converting the neighborhood’s abandoned lots and buildings into affordable housing, and the <a href="//www.westelmwood.org" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">West Elmwood Housing Development Corporation</a> offers affordable housing and home-ownership programs for local residents. These organizations and others have fostered a new era in Elmwood’s history. It is an architecturally and culturally rich neighborhood, and efforts continue to ensure there are equitable and sustainable opportunities for those who live and work here.</p>
