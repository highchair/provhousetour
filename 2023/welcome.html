  <p>I am excited that this summer, visitors, residents, and community members will have the opportunity to explore the historic charm and beautiful architecture our Elmwood neighborhood has to offer.</p>
  <p>Neighborhoods like Elmwood are what make Providence a flourishing and culturally rich city and I am grateful we have partners like the Providence Preservation Society to help showcase its vibrant beauty.</p>
  <p>Thank you for your work in making Providence the world-class city it has the potential to be and for all of your efforts in preserving our city’s historic ambiance.</p>
  <p><i>Sincerely,</i><br>

  <h1 class="h2">A Message from our Executive Director</h1>
  <p class="lead">Welcome to the Providence Preservation Society’s Festival of Historic Houses!</p>
  <p><img class="img-fluid align-left" src="{% link assets/guidebook/Brent-Runyon.jpg %}" alt="" /></p>
  <p>We return this year to Elmwood, a neighborhood listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Much of the neighborhood is also a city-designated local historic district, which has encouraged the highest level of preservation and restoration throughout the decades.</p>
  <p>In 2014, my first year as director of the Society, Providence was recognized as the “Most Exciting Mid-Sized City” for its youthfulness, live music, nightlife, restaurants, and outdoor activities. Over the past nine years, Providence has lived up to this moniker. In 2023, my final year as director, we have a new mayor, and the city is buzzing again.</p>
  <p>To enhance your visit, we encourage you to stop by <a href="//rwpzoo.org" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">Roger Williams Park and Zoo</a>, just south of Elmwood. And don’t miss nearby businesses and restaurants on Elmwood Avenue and on Broad Street, Providence’s center of Latin culture and cuisine. You’ll also find the cuisine of numerous other cultures.</p>
  <p>Please support our efforts to uplift and celebrate historic Providence by <a href="//pvdpreservation.org/membership" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">becoming a member of the Providence Preservation Society</a>. Your support means more advocacy for historic preservation, thoughtful design, and people-centered planning in Providence. And you will get early notice about future events, like next year’s Festival!</p>
  <p>Thank you for joining us this weekend.<br>
