      <h2 class="h3">Modernism Week Pass</h2>
      <p>Purchase a Modernism Week Pass! A Pass gives you entry to the following programs and events listed below. It does not include entry to events with a capacity of 30 or less – those walking tours and field trips must be booked individually to ensure we do not register beyond capacity. Modernism Week Passes are only available for purchase through October 1.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>October 5: Keynote Address and Opening Reception, Designing Home: Jews and Midcentury Modernism</li>
        <li>October 8: Collecting Modern</li>
        <li>October 9: Mid Mod Cocktail Party</li>
