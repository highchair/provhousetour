      <p>Purchase a Modernism Week Pass! A Pass gives you entry to the following programs and events listed below. It does not include entry to events with a capacity of 30 or less – those walking tours and field trips must be booked individually to ensure we do not register beyond capacity.

      <ul>
        <li>October 5: Keynote Address and Opening Reception, Designing Home: Jews and Midcentury Modernism</li>
