      <h2 class="h3">Saturday, June 4</h2>

      <p class="lead">Self-guided tours of private homes and gardens on Keene Street and Lloyd Avenue, hosted by the Providence Preservation Society. 10am – 4pm</p>
      <p>Keene Street and Lloyd Avenue are an intimate part of the tree-lined neighborhoods north of Brown University between Angell and Olney Streets. The earliest houses in this area appeared in the 1850s and by the 1870s, ample Second Empire and Italianate style houses dotted the neighborhood. The building boom of the 1880s and 1890s saw a blend of Queen Anne and Colonial Revival houses, all comfortable in size, rich in detail, and set back from the streets to allow for a dense landscape of flora. The proximity to Brown University and Rhode Island School of Design (<span class="abbr">RISD</span>) also attracted professors to this burgeoning enclave, while the nearby Thayer Street commercial district provided household needs and entertainment.</p>

      <h2 class="h3">Sunday, June 5</h2>
  
      <p class="lead">Exclusive guided tour of a private Providence garden, hosted by the Garden Conservancy. 2pm — 4 pm</p>
      <h3 class="h4">Digging Deeper: Creating a Cottage Garden From Scratch</h3>
      <p>Digging Deeper with garden owners Hope Alswang and Henry Joyce and landscape architect Laura Willson who worked with Ms. Alswang and Mr. Joyce on the realization of the new garden. The 80' by 80' space was conceived as a traditional parterre with four 16' square beds surrounded by gravel paths in the colonial revival style popular about a hundred years ago. A one room summer house/folly with lattice sides is a focus of the space viewed from the house. Old fashioned perennial planting with climbing roses give the landscape its cottage garden sensibility. Now, maturing the garden has an intriguingly wild effect. The session in the garden will include before and in progress photos to describe how the plan evolved and was implemented to give different textures and colors in each season. Future plans will also be discussed.</p>
