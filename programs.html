          <p>Open to the public since 1871, Roger Williams Park was intended to serve as a restorative escape for those living and working in increasingly urban Providence from the very beginning. Today, the park’s 435 beautiful acres include expansive manicured grounds, public gardens, walking paths, and several historic buildings in full use for public enjoyment. Stroll the park with a knowledgeable guide to learn more about its origins as part of the Urban Parks Movement and the efforts required to maintain this important community resource today. </p>

          <h2 class="h4">Rehabilitating a Historic Garden: Preserving Living History at Shakespeare’s Head, <i>a virtual presentation by landscape architect Elena Pascarella, PLA, ASLA</i></h2>
           
          <p>What is a cultural landscape and why do they matter? Landscape Architect Elena Pascarella discusses these questions and more in relation to PPS’s own Colonial Revival garden behind the building known as Shakespeare’s Head (the John and Amey Carter house). Pascarella’s firm, Landscape Elements LLC, recently completed a Cultural Landscape Report for this PPS urban garden, one which considers historic character, climate change, sustainability, and visitor access to this 80-year-old garden in need of refreshing. Elena will present her findings and treatment recommendations in this engaging talk about a hidden jewel of a garden in downtown Providence.</p>

          <p>This year’s Festival features gardens, rather than houses, but most of them complement beautiful historic homes. While we can’t invite you inside this year, local architect and RISD professor James Barnes will explore how these homes and gardens navigate the relationship between the public life of the street and private lives within. Learn more about the history of these buildings before touring their eye-catching landscapes on June 12.</p>

          <p>There are few more photographed landscapes in Providence than Adam Anderson’s 10,000 SUNS installation, which sets a field of riotous sunflowers against the dramatic city skyline. In 2019, Anderson expanded his landscape vision along the Providence River, with the creation of the nearby Living Edge pocket park that addresses ideas around climate change, community, resilience, and history. Join the mastermind behind these two iconic landscapes on this tour that highlights the ways in which these urban greenspaces enhance and are enhanced by the built environment.</p>
