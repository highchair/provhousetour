        <p class="lead">Mythbusting Providence’s Local Historic Districts, part of our slate of pre-Festival virtual educational programming. 6 pm</p>
        <p>Have you ever wondered what a Local Historic District (<span class="abbr">LHD</span>) is and how it works? Are you planning a renovation and are confused about what you can and can’t do? Do you currently live outside an <span class="abbr">LHD</span> and have thought about extending those benefits to your home or neighborhood?
        <p>Historic districting, or defining zones that bestow certain protections for the buildings within them, emerged in the mid-20th Century as a means of protecting architectural heritage from demolition and urban development and has since become one of the most reliable tools in historic preservation — to both powerful and problematic ends. Many residents live in one of Providence’s nine Local Historic Districts, but confusion abounds about what these districts actually regulate and how. PPS Director of Preservation Rachel Robinson breaks down the history, regulatory power, and limitations of LHDs during this virtual Rehabbers Resources presentation and Q&amp;A.</p>
