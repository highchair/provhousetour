        <p class="lead">Mythbusting Providence’s Local Historic Districts, part of our slate of pre-Festival virtual educational programming. 6 pm</p>
        <p>Have you ever wondered what a Local Historic District (<span class="abbr">LHD</span>) is and how it works? Are you planning a renovation and are confused about what you can and can’t do? Do you currently live outside an <span class="abbr">LHD</span> and have thought about extending those benefits to your home or neighborhood?
        <p>Historic districting, or defining zones that bestow certain protections for the buildings within them, emerged in the mid-20th Century as a means of protecting architectural heritage from demolition and urban development and has since become one of the most reliable tools in historic preservation — to both powerful and problematic ends. Many residents live in one of Providence’s nine Local Historic Districts, but confusion abounds about what these districts actually regulate and how. <span class="abbr">PPS</span> Director of Preservation Rachel Robinson breaks down the history, regulatory power, and limitations of <span class="abbr">LHD</span>s during this virtual Rehabbers Resources presentation and Q&amp;A.</p>
