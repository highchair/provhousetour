    The Groden Center is a non-public special education school and treatment program. Founded in 1976 by Doctors June and Gerry Groden, The Groden Center main building is located on the East Side of Providence with two classrooms of older students located at their Manton Avenue campus. They serve students ages 6 to 22 and offer a broad range of individualized services in a traditional, unrestrictive setting, to empower learners with autism and related disorders. They believe in fostering consistent, coordinated teaching strategies across all disciplines and environments. In addition to a 12-month day program, The Groden Center offers residential programs for families who need that option. Students are referred and funded by their local school district. The group residences are licensed by the Department of Children, Youth and Families. Their educational model focuses on behavioral and positive psychology approaches, with practices including ABA techniques, positive behavior supports, and improving well-being through education on kindness, resiliency, optimism, and other areas.

  house-name: 'Roxana and Luther Salisbury House'
  house-detail: '<i>c. 1849</i><br>Owned by Colgate Searle, Jr.'
  house-description: | 
    The Roxana and Luther Salisbury House was constructed in c. 1849 and is one of the neighborhood’s oldest residences. The house is a good example of the Cape Cod type, with characteristic features such as a center entrance with a glazed transom and sidelights, plain pilasters, and cornice returns. The modest yet iconic Cape Cod house became widespread in the early 19th century and was common for New England farmhouses. The house’s form and style contrast with the larger and more high style residences constructed on Larch Street and the surrounding areas later in the 19th century. The Salisburys owned the entire block between Ivy and Hope into the late 1880s.
    
    Luther Salisbury was born in 1802 near Glocester, RI and worked as a farmer. He married Roxana Johnson Salisbury who was born in 1811 in Mansfield, CT. They married in 1828 and lived in Pawtucket before settling in Providence. They had three children: Mary Elizabeth; Harriet; and a son, Richard, who died at 6 months of age. Luther managed a farm at his home on Forest Street and employed farming assistants who lived on site. He was elected to the Providence City Convention in 1848.
    
    The Salisbury farm was a family affair. Eldest daughter Mary married Theodore H. Eaton in 1849. The couple resided at 50 Forest Street after their marriage and had one son, William Luther Eaton. Theodore worked as a machinist until his untimely death of consumption in 1855 at the age of 28. Mary and William remained at 50 Forest Street, and William continued the tradition of working as a laborer and machinist on the family farm.
    
    Harriet Salisbury never married, remaining independent throughout her life. She worked as a public school teacher at Prospect Street Intermediate School in Providence in the mid-19th century. She lived at 50 Forest Street her entire life and inherited the property upon her mother’s death in 1893. Her nephew William Eaton managed the farm, while also working as a milkman in the early 20th century. He inherited the property upon her death in 1909. William Eaton was an early adopter of the automobile, and The Providence Journal reported the delivery of at least five touring cars to 50 Forest Street between 1908 and 1914.
    
    William and his wife Margaret adopted their niece, Helen, who worked as a teacher. Margaret inherited the property and retained ownership until her death in 1942. The estate conveyed to her daughter Helen and Helen’s husband Frank J. Murphy. The Murphys resided there until c. 1968. 
    Leslie M. and Duncan Smith owned the house from 1968 to 1973. Mary S. Foote owned the property from 1973-1976. The current owner acquired the property in 1976.

  house-name: 'Adelaide S. and Samuel M. Gray House'
  house-detail: '<i>1881</i><br>Owned by James and Ruth Dealy'
  house-description: | 
    52 Larch Street was constructed by Adelaide and Samuel Gray in 1881. Samuel Merrill Gray was born in Andover, MA in 1842 and worked as a civil engineer in Providence. He specialized in hydraulic engineering, surveying, and bridge inspections. He served as the Providence City Engineer from 1877 until 1890. In that role, he represented Providence on a tour to study hydraulic systems across Europe. After 1890, he was self-employed as a consulting engineer who designed major water and sewage systems in Washington D.C., Baltimore, Louisville, Denver, and other major cities in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. In 1899, he was invited to Havana, Cuba to develop the city’s sewage and drainage system. In 1907, The Providence Journal called him “one of the leading authorities on municipal engineering in the United States.” His most significant commissions took place while he lived at 52 Larch Street. His wife Adelaide “Addie” Sophia Gilbert Gray was born in Hartford, CT. She died in 1891, shortly after the house at 52 Larch Street was constructed.
    
    In 1900, Samuel lived at 52 Larch Street with his daughter Edith, a professional artist, and his son Robert, a student at Yale. His sister Sarah and her husband George H. Doyle, who also worked as a hydraulic engineer, resided with the Grays. The family had one live-in servant, Julia A. Sullivan, who was born in Ireland.
    
    In 1910, Samuel lived with his son Robert, who was then 33 years old and working as an analytical chemist. He worked at the RI State Board of Health before moving to Miami in 1926. George H. Doyle continued to reside at the house, but his wife Sarah is not listed in Providence House Directories after 1907. His brother-in-law Frederick W. Gilbert and sister-in-law Georgie R. Gilbert also resided at the house. The family continued to employ one live-in servant, Hilda Hendrickson, who was born in Sweden.
    
    In 1919, the property was advertised for sale as a 10-room house with recent improvements. The ad noted its “extra good location” and that “$1000 cash will buy it.” Household furniture and goods were offered for sale around the same time, including a 1918 Ford touring car. Many property owners in this neighborhood were early adopters of the automobile. Samuel Gray sold the property to Paul Shocker in 1920 and relocated to North Kingstown. He continued to work as an engineer until his death at age 80 in 1921.
    
    Mary and Paul Shocker owned 52 Larch Street from 1920 to c. 1925. Paul was a German immigrant who arrived in the United States in 1856. He was self-employed as a jewelry designer, diamond setter, and appraiser at the Paul Shocker Co. on Westminster Street. His wife Mary Kenyon Shocker was born in Rhode Island to parents who were English and Scottish immigrants. They had one daughter, Ida M. Shocker, whose occupation is listed as “Christian Science Practitioner” in the 1920 census. She also worked as an artist who sold ceramic and glass wares at her father’s shop downtown.
    
    Mary Shocker died in 1928 and Paul Shocker died in 1929. The property was sold to John Robbins in c. 1925. John was born in Virginia, and his wife Elizabeth was born in Maryland. They had two children, John, Jr. and Mary, who were both born in Virginia. Both John Sr. and Jr. worked as carpenters in the contracting industry, and Mary worked as a clerk at an insurance company. The family housed three boarders at the house in 1930: Willimina Jones, a Canadian immigrant who worked as a clerk at a bakery; John Holland, a Rhode Islander who worked as a nurse at a hospital; and John’s wife Katherine A. Holland, who worked as a clerk in a dry goods store. The Shocker family and their boarders represented new trends of women entering the workforce in the early-to-mid 20th century. Their neighbors on Larch Street at the time worked in similar fields and positions, and many families continued to have live-in servants.
    
    Hormisdas H. San Souci and his wife Leonora Dubeau San Souci acquired the property in c. 1944. The San Souci family were French-Canadian immigrants from Ronsecours, Canada. They immigrated to the United States and settled in Central Falls in 1916. That year, Hormisdas worked as a carpenter in a machine shop, daughter Bella worked as a baller in a thread mill, daughter Loretta worked as a stamper in a bleachery, and son Edgar worked as a telegraph manager. Loretta San Souci Sylvester inherited the property after the death of her parents in 1951 and 1952. After the death of her husband Arsene J. Sylvester in 1955, she continued to live there with their son Edgar A. Sylvester. Edgar served in the U.S. Navy while living at 52 Larch Street in the 1950s.
    
    The property was sold to Elinor and Edward E. Erminelli in 1976, and the current owners acquired the house in 1978.

  house-name: 'Mary T. and James M. Turner House'
  house-detail: '<i>1857</i><br>Owned by Lucie G. Searle'
  house-description: | 
    The Mary T. and James M. Turner House was constructed in 1857. Mary T. Turner was one of the earliest landowners on Larch Street after the Mount Hope neighborhood was platted. She acquired three adjacent lots on the north side of the street between 1857 and 1859. With her husband James, she constructed a house in the center lot at 26 Larch Street in c. 1857. City tax ledgers indicate a building had been constructed by September 1857. The house first appears on atlas maps in 1875. The house’s footprint has changed over time, and it may have been constructed in several campaigns.
    
    Mary T. Turner was born in Scotland in 1816. She married Massachusetts native James Madison Turner and settled in Providence, where the pair raised four children. James was self-employed as a painter at James M. Turner Co., Painters on North Main Street. Following his death, the property was offered for sale and described as “a fine house with large, pleasant rooms, good cellars… and many fine fruit trees, grape vines, and shrubs.” Another advertisement noted it had recently received “two coats of paint,” possibly by Turner before he passed away.
    
    In 1885, Mary Turner sold the property to Sarah Ann and James D. Thornton. James was born in Ireland to English parents, and he emigrated to the United States in 1861. He had previously owned homes on Camp Street and Barnes Street before acquiring 26 Larch Street, which the Thornton family would own for 26 years. During that time, James worked as a manager at Allen Print Works on Dryden Lane. For a brief time, Henry C. Thornton (likely a relative) also lived at 26 Larch. Henry worked as a calico printer’s engraver and later as an architect. Henry partnered with his brother-in-law as Banning & Thornton (1903-1912) and completed locally important commissions such as the Colonial Revival remodeling of the Old State House in 1906, Temple Beth-El on Broad Street in 1910, and at least five schools between 1903-1909.
    
    James Thornton died in 1904, and his estate offered the property for sale at auction. In c. 1907, his son Christopher and daughter-in-law Mary acquired the property. Christopher was employed with his father at Allen Print Works, and by 1910 he had worked his way up from color maker to superintendent to manager.
    
    Italian immigrants Emilia Bertolaccini Danesi and her husband Amadeo Danesi purchased the property in c. 1912. Like many Italian immigrants to Providence, they first settled and established businesses in Federal Hill. They had five children at the time they purchased 26 Larch Street and would have two more between 1917 and 1925 while living at the house. Amadeo made his career in the hospitality industry, and The Providence Journal described him as a “culinary master.” In partnership with his brother-in-law as Danesi & Bertolaccini, he managed the restaurant at The Hotel Newman on Aborn Street in the 1910s. He later worked as superintendent of the Hebe Company bottlers on Atwells Avenue and as a traveling salesman in the 1920s and early 1930s. In 1939, he acquired the Hotel Warren and relocated his family to the East Bay.
    
    The Danesi family sold 26 Larch Street to Imelda O. and Edwin G. Tilley in c. 1946. The house was described at that time as a “spacious home in stunning condition with tiled bath, Timken burner, beautiful floors, large solarium, four bedrooms with extra lavette, and bedroom down[stairs]…”
    
    The house was sold to Bertha and Samuel Kasper in 1948. Samuel Kasper was born in Russian Poland. His family immigrated to the United States during the Revolution of 1905-1907, during which time Jewish citizens faced pogroms and persecution. They settled in Olneyville, where a small Jewish neighborhood had taken root. He began working at a young age and is recorded as a bookkeeper in the 1920 census. As an adult, he was self-employed as an accountant. Samuel married Bertha Bazarsky, who was also born in Russia and settled in South Providence. She worked as a bookkeeper for Cameo Jewelry and Roberts Manufacturing Company in Providence. In 1948, Bertha hosted an organizational meeting at 26 Larch Street to support the construction of a new building for Congregation Ahavath Sholom (now Temple Beth-El) in the neighborhood at Camp Street and Rochambeau Avenue. She served as committee chairperson and a leader in the neighborhood’s Jewish community, hosting teas and other events at 26 Larch Street.
    
    The property was purchased by Eleanor R. and Irving K. Taylor in c. 1963. Eleanor was born in Providence. Her husband Irving was born in New Jersey and attended Brown University and the Rhode Island School of Design before working as an architect and preservationist. In 1962, he worked as a draftsman at Harkness & Geddes and would later serve as an architect at several different firms. He was employed as the University of Rhode Island campus architect in 1987 until his retirement in 2005.
    
    Mollie G. and Richard M. Cady purchased the house in c. 1973, and the current owner acquired the house in 1987.
    
    ### About the Garden: 
    This property is distinguished by numerous outdoor “rooms” that create a series of secret gardens. From Larch Street, one sees a large front and side yard; but follow the path to discover a small farm behind the house that encompasses the interior area between Larch, Forest and Camp Streets. Along the way, you will discover beautiful decorative plantings; pergolas, patios, and a potting station; a myriad of vegetables, fruits and herbs; bee hives and compost units; and numerous architectural “saves” from historic Providence buildings. The property owner grew up on a small family farm in Exeter RI and sought to replicate that experience on a smaller and urban scale. This farm within the city has been created over a period of almost 40 years with a view towards a food producing landscape that incorporates sustainability, recycling and an emphasis on local cultivars that support the native ecology (think plants that attract bees, birds and butterflies).
    
    Highlights of the garden include:
    + Terra Cotta Cornerstone, rescued in 1990 when the Outlet Department Store (first in the nation) was demolished. Stewardia Tree (next to cornerstone).
    + Patio for al fresco dining. Large stones and steps, rescued from a former manufacturing site on Dexter Street when the building was rehabbed and converted to affordable housing. Planter bases are terra cotta from the Canonicus (and then Abbott Park) Hotel on Weybosset Street, demolished in 1991.
    + Pergola-covered potting station with sandstone sink at garage end and a stainless steel counter salvaged from the kitchen of the former Dreyfus Hotel. Help yourself to a glass of water here.
    + The “Big Garden” contains many veggies, including over 10 varieties of tomatoes, all started from seed in the owner’s sunroom; and do note the bean poles which support heirloom beans handed down from the owner’s great grandfather.
    + Tired? Hot? Have a seat under one of the pergolas — at the west end (right hand side) of the garden or the middle. At the west end, the large marble patio slab was a bathroom divider from the Dreyfus Hotel. And note the use of saved decorative stone from the Outlet and the Abbott Park Hotel.
    + Don’t miss the Camp Street end of the garden (left side) to check out the garlic, the raspberries, and the compost bins.
    + And as you stroll, be sure to note the plant labels if you are curious about the names.

  house-name: 'Ella M. and George B. Olney Carriage House'
  house-detail: '<i>1895</i><br>Owned by The Tower Family'
  house-description: | 
    31 Larch Street was constructed as a barn and carriage house for 35 Larch Street. The building is referred to over time by different terms, such as stable, barn, and garage.
    
    The house at 35 Larch Street was constructed in 1886 by Ezekiel Owen (1813-1905). It is one of Larch Street’s finest 19th century residences and is in an excellent state of preservation. The high style Queen Anne house incorporates elements of the Shingle Style and the Colonial Revival, which emerged and gained popularity around this time.
    
    The city’s tax ledgers show a building, likely the carriage house, added to the lot in c. 1895 by the next owners, Ella M. Olney and her husband George B. Olney. The carriage house first appears on a 1908 atlas map at the rear of a curved driveway. Ella and George were both born in Rhode Island, and George worked as a merchant in the coal industry. In 1910, the family had two live-in servants. Joseph S. Lewis, a Portuguese immigrant, managed “General Work, House + Barn.” The family at one time also employed a coachman who worked in the carriage house.
    
    By c. 1913, jewelry manufacturer Asher Abel Starck and his wife Nellie G. Starck owned the property. In 1920, they lived with their sons Rossiter and Howard who both attended the Camp Street School. They also employed one servant, Katherine Callahan. No servants specifically assigned to the carriage house were noted at this time. The Starck family would retain ownership of both buildings into the 1940s.
    
    By 1949, the property was owned by the Rakatansky family. In the 1950 census, two dwellings are noted on the property; it is possible that one of these was the carriage house, which was zoned for residential use by 1940. The main house was owned and occupied by Russian immigrants Martha and Benjamin Rakatansky. Benjamin worked as a building construction carpenter. They lived with their son Ira Rakatansky, who would become Providence’s leading Modernist architect. Having graduated from RISD in 1942 and Harvard in 1943, Ira was a young architect just starting his career at this time. He established his own practice in 1949 and began commissions primarily for private residences in Modern idioms across Rhode Island and Massachusetts. He also completed designs for new synagogues and churches and renovations to existing religious buildings in Providence.
    
    The second dwelling referenced, likely the carriage house, was home to Benjamin’s daughter Charlotte Rakatansky Primack, her husband Samuel Primack, and their daughter Sarah R. Primack. Charlotte worked as a secretary before her marriage, and Samuel worked as a salesman for wholesale menswear.
    
    The property was sold at auction in 1953, following the death of Martha Rakatansky in 1951. Later in the 1950s and into the 1960s, 35 Larch Street was home to Shirley Wilson Lee, a civil rights activist known for her work on public housing in Providence. She lived at 35 Larch Street with her husband Erastus H. Lee, a professor at Brown University. In addition to her political and social advocacy, Shirley was one of the founding members of the Mount Hope Neighborhood Association.
    
    In 1976, owner John A. Finger, Jr. received approval to combine the three lots that had historically composed the property and to renovate and adapt the “second floor of a carriage house on the property into an apartment.” The property is currently a single-family house on a separate lot from 35 Larch Street.

  house-description: | 
    Chester Franklin Upham (1834-1909) was born in Dudley, MA. He relocated to Providence by the early 1850s and built a successful career as an insurance and real estate broker. He acquired the 45 Larch Street lot from Ezekiel Owen, owner of 35 Larch Street, in 1898. He hired architect Howard K. Hilton of Providence to design a residence. The house blends elements of the Queen Anne and Colonial Revival. Upham retired as a broker shortly after settling on Larch Street. He was married twice, to Esther Wales Upham (1833-1872), who died before he purchased 45 Larch Street, and Ellen Brown Upham.
    
    Chester sold the property to Ellen M. and Dennis Wholey in 1907. Dennis worked as a boiler manufacturer and established the Wholey Boiler Works in 1894 on Whipple Street in Providence. His son Thomas V. Wholey (1874-1932) worked alongside him and expanded the business into a well-known regional company.
    
    Between 1923-1926, the property was listed as vacant in the Providence House Directories. It was purchased by Thomas Francis Power in c. 1927. He was single at the time of the purchase. Thomas worked as a truck driver and salesman for Ward Baking Co. at 461 Eddy Street in the 1930s. He was later employed by the city at the Providence Fire Department and Providence Post Office. In 1956, he sold the property to Jacquelin A. and Nelson M. Wright. A photograph from the time of the sale shows the house appears the same as it does today.
    
    Nelson M. Wright (1925-1976) was born in Honolulu, HI to a family that hailed from East Providence. He married Jacquelin A. O’Brien (1930-2011), who worked as a jewelry store associate. Nelson was a prolific business manager for a variety of regional companies. Around the time he and his wife owned 45 Larch Street, he was the manager of Providence’s Avon Theatre, Wright Chevrolet in North Attleboro, the Hope Amusement Co., and Crescent Park Recreation Corp. In the late 1950s, he worked in Boston and commuted from 45 Larch Street. He established Wright Enterprises to book films at regional movie theaters.
    
    The property was sold to the current owners in 1970.

  house-name: 'Augusta and Benjamin Kaufman House'
  house-detail: '<i>1926-1928</i><br>Owned by Emily Kloeblen'
  house-description: | 
    The Augusta and Benjamin Kaufman house was constructed c. 1926-1928. In 1918, the land was owned by the Dennis Wholey estate as part of the 45 Larch Street parcel. The house is a good example of a Dutch Colonial Revival, with the style’s characteristic gambrel roof. It has an attractive entrance portico and a glazed elliptical transom at the principal entrance fronting Ivy Street. A freestanding garage is original to the house, marking the widespread adoption of the automobile by this time.
    
    Augusta and Benjamin Kaufman were Russian Jewish immigrants to Providence. They were born in Odessa, then part of the Russian Empire in what is now Ukraine. Augusta immigrated to the United States in 1891 and Benjamin in 1902. In 1915, they lived at 18 Larch Street. Benjamin worked as the proprietor of a dry goods and clothing store, and their son Maxwell was a student at Camp Street School. In 1920, they lived on Oakland Street in Elmhurst. Benjamin then owned an auto repair shop. They purchased the 92 Ivy Street lot in 1926 and constructed the house between 1926 and 1928. Augusta died in September 1927, shortly after the purchase of the lot; it is unknown if the house was constructed before her death. Benjamin remarried to Anna G. Kaufman before 1935. In the 1920s and 1930s, he was the president of the Modern Auto Top Co., Inc. auto repair shop and later of the Modern Supply Co. cosmetics wholesaler. The Kaufmans employed one live-in servant.
    
    The property was sold to Jacob and Bessie Lecht in c. 1941. Joseph was an immigrant from Rovno, Russia who was self-employed in Providence as a wholesale butcher. The couple had three children, Rose, Bessie, and Irving. At the time of the 1950 census, Rose (40) and Bessie (37) had never married. The property was sold to Leona C. and A. Frank Berube in c. 1956. Arthur Frank Berube was a business manager at the Burroughs Corporation. He and his wife resided in East Providence before relocating to 92 Ivy Street.
    
    Selig and Miriam Greenberg purchased the property in 1956. They lived on Forest Street prior to the purchase. Selig was a Russian immigrant who worked as a news reporter for The Providence Journal for 50 years. He was posthumously inducted into the RI Journalism Hall of Fame in 2000. The Greenbergs owned 92 Ivy Street until c. 1966.
    
    Subsequent property owners included Cleon E. and Dorothy M. Harvey; David Konstan; and Timothy Hebert. The current owner acquired the property in 2018.

  house-name: 'Albert A. Gamwell House'
  house-detail: '<i>1868</i><br>Owned by Thomas Russell and Amy Rittenhouse'
  house-description: | 
    The vibrantly colored Second Empire cottage at 168 Cypress Street features a large, slate-mansard-roof, 3-bay-façade, and a tall rectangular cupola. The home was built in 1868 for public school teacher Albert A. Gamwell. The lot of land upon which the home is located was purchased by Gamwell in 1856, with the extant structure built around 1868. In the 1870 census, the Gamwell family included Albert, his wife Phoebe, their four young children, and an Irish servant named Bridget Clyne.
    
    In 1872, after Gamwell’s death, his widow Phoebe sold their entire estate, which included six lots between Cypress and Larch Streets, to Ephraim R. Barstow. Barstow operated an iron foundry, and was the half-brother of Amos Barstow, 3rd mayor of Providence and founder of the Barstow Stove Company. By 1875, a stable was built to the rear of the home, and an additional garage was added to the home in 1895. 
    
    The property remained in the Barstow family until 1909, after which it passed through a number of families, including the Charren family, who were immigrants from Odessa, Ukraine and lived at 168 Cypress from 1915-1950. The father, Max Charren, ran a clothing store with the help of his children, Harry and Anna. In the early 1960s, Mildred Howe, a teacher of design, lived in the property. Mildred was a member of the Baha’i faith, and hosted frequent gatherings and lectures on behalf of the Baha’i Assembly of Providence.
    
    The current owners purchased the property in 1993. Of particular note is the still functional 1860s stove from the Barstow Stove Company in the family kitchen.

  house-name: 'Edward Irving Drowne House'
  house-detail: '<i>1903, Murphy & Hindle, architects</i><br>Owned by Amy Anderson and Patrick Torborg'
  house-description: | 
    Of the eleven houses built on Catalpa Road, the Drowne residence was among the first of the set to be constructed in 1903. The Gilbane Construction Company sought to build what became perhaps the earliest example of suburban tract housing – a residential subdivision – in the region.
    
    Demand in the city was high for modestly scaled single-family dwellings that met the needs of a middle-class family in early-20th century Providence. Coupled with this demand, streetcar service had been in place along nearby Camp Street since 1886 and North Main Street since 1875. This extension of public transportation made the remoteness of the Mount Hope neighborhood attractive for real estate brokers to market the land for development. In the August 10, 1903, edition of the Providence Journal, the first set of houses to be built along newly established Catalpa Road was announced: “…to Real Estate Improvement Company, for five 2-1/2 story one-family dwellings on Catalpa Road…”
    
    The first occupant of 2 Catalpa Road was real estate broker Edward Irving Drowne and his family. Drowne was successful in his career in real estate, which, according to his 1921 obituary, he was regarded as “one of the three Providence real estate operators of 40 years ago, and for many years had an office in the Industrial Trust Company building. Many of the improvements in the city and state really are the result of his foresight and wise suggestions, and he served on many important commissions connected with the growth of the city.”
    
    Edward was the son of Solomon H. and Susan Leonard Drowne. His grandfather, also Solomon, was a botany professor at Brown University as well as a surgeon in the Revolutionary War. Edward married Anna Louise Brown in June 1873. They had four children, including sons Russell Sears and George Leonard Drowne.
    
    By the time of the 1900 Federal Census, the Drowne family resided at 97 Taber Avenue in Providence. The family relocated to Catalpa Road by the end of 1903. Russell Drowne worked briefly as a real estate office clerk, likely alongside his father, but resigned due to physical limitations. Russell’s true passion was in literature. He studied literature, many of the fine arts, and devoted much of his time to local and national civic causes. Russell wrote extensively to local newspapers and periodicals, submitted essays and letters, all pertaining to the causes that faced the country. His 1917 obituary regarded him as possessing “a constant cheerfulness,” which reflected in his writings as a humorist. His health gradually declined in the last year of his life, and he died on February 11, 1917. Russell’s brother George worked initially as a college instructor, but soon shifted careers and became ordained in the Episcopal Church. He relocated to New Bedford Massachusetts, where he served as Reverend of the Grace Church parish in that city. Following the death of Anna Drowne in 1920, Edward relocated to New Bedford to live with his son George. Edward died on May 7, 1921 and was interred in Swan Point Cemetery with his family.
    
    Following Edward’s death, the house was sold to real estate agent James H. Hurley. The Hurley family resided at 2 Catalpa Road until 1935, when it was acquired by hat manufacturer Theodore J. Bochford. Bochford’s ownership of 2 Catalpa was brief, and the house was acquired by Judge John P. Cooney, Jr., and his wife Margaret in 1936. The Cooney family was extensive. John and Margaret had twelve children – seven boys and five girls – all residing on Catalpa Road. The household was active, with John being considered as a candidate for the Democratic delegation for the Rhode Island Constitutional Convention in 1936. Cooney was the clerk for the 6th District Court for many years, and by 1950, he announced his candidacy in the Providence mayoral election. His bid was unsuccessful. At the time of the 1950 Federal Census, the Cooney family included John P., Margaret, and their children: John P. III, Michael, Robert, Terence, James, Patrick, Margaret, Clara, Kathleen, Agnes, Anne, and Edward. The Providence Journal featured the Cooney family in a July 1953 society article “Fun, Song and Work Move the Cooneys to Matunuck,” while the family was vacationing in South Kingstown. Judge Cooney died in 1981 and his widow Margaret sold the house in 1982 to Michael Saks.
    
    The house transferred hands several times before being acquired by the current homeowners in August 2020.

  house-description: | 
    Part of the final set of houses built by Gilbane Construction Company, 16 Catalpa Road was originally occupied by provisions salesman George E. Gaffney and his wife Caroline Cole in 1904. After the initial five houses were constructed and sold by Gilbane at the southern end of Catalpa Road, the company completed their project with six remaining houses. The designs – based on two floor plans with varying exteriors – allowed for efficient building practices while avoiding monotony along the street.
    
    [The floor plan and exterior of 16 Catalpa is identical to that of 2 Catalpa, which is also included in this year’s tour.]
    
    George and Caroline Gaffney appear to have lived alone while at 16 Catalpa, and their residency at the house was brief. According to the 1900 Federal Census, the couple resided in New Bedford Massachusetts and had Caroline’s brother and George’s elderly aunt living with them. The couple relocated to Providence in October 1904, acquiring 16 Catalpa for $100 and other considerations. The purchase, however, was made by Caroline Gaffney. This was a common practice for middle-class households meant to protect their assets. By placing ownership under Caroline’s name, this would protect the property should George’s business fail. Though their residency at 16 Catalpa was brief, their travels were frequently documented in the Providence Journal, with the couple seasonally closing their Providence house to stay at their summer home in the Paskamansett Heights neighborhood of Dartmouth, Massachusetts.
    
    By April 1908, the house was acquired by Frank P. Carleton, and the Providence House Directory of 1909 lists Lewis Carleton as a resident, with no occupation. The house changed hands again in October 1910, when it was acquired by Mary McDonald, a nurse.
    
    Prior to Mary McDonald’s occupancy at 16 Catalpa, she found herself as an important witness to a court case involving the contesting of a will. The case involved the will of a wealthy jewelry manufacturer, Fred A. Newell, of Attleboro, Massachusetts. Mary McDonald was the nurse who attended to Mr. Newell on nights for several months leading up to his death at St. Joseph’s Hospital in Providence. Prior to his death, the estate plans were changed, with Mary witnessing the codicil that was ultimately contested in court. Mary’s testimony was taken directly from her own hospital bed, while recovering from surgery at St. Joseph’s Hospital. Following her recovery, Mary finally moved into her home on Catalpa Road. In the 1913 Providence House Directory, she is listed as residing at 16 Catalpa with Charles S. Vreeland, a boarder who was a shoe salesman, and another boarder Samuel T. Apollonia. Mary died on July 10, 1917, and the contents of the house were auctioned off on August 20, 1917. The house was soon acquired by Alice W. Troy for $6,350.
    
    Alice Wallace Troy was the wife of attorney George Francis Troy and with their three children, resided at 16 Catalpa for several years before relocating in 1925. Alice made 16 Catalpa the center of her social activities. She was involved in numerous women’s clubs including the Elmwood Round Table Club. Alice routinely hosted events at the house benefiting social causes, such as children’s orphanages and those assisting the homeless. By 1925, the house was acquired by the McGreen family. It was during the McGreen family’s ownership of 16 Catalpa that various members of the family occupied the house for nearly 50 years.
    
    Thomas McGreen acquired the house in 1925. He was a retired mason, originally from Bellows Falls, Vermont. He and his brother Joseph married the Savage sisters, Margaret, and Nora respectively. Originally from Ladysbridge, County Cork, Ireland, the Savage family immigrated to America in 1867, finally settling in Bellows Falls, Vermont in 1881. Margaret and Thomas married that year, and soon had a family of six children. Thomas lived at 16 Catalpa for less than a year, dying in 1926 at the age of 77. His widow Margaret continued to reside at the house until her death in 1943 at the age of 88. Their daughter Olive continued to reside at the property while working as a schoolteacher at the Summit Avenue School. After her death in 1958, 16 Catalpa was occupied by her brother Joseph A. McGreen. Joseph was a postal worker, having started at the downtown Providence Post Office at the age of 24 in 1917. He retired after 40 years of employment at the downtown branch. Joseph was a World War I Navy veteran as well as a member of the American Legion. He died on June 4, 1973, at the age of 80.
    
    Following Joseph A. McGreen’s death, the house transferred several times before being acquired by the current homeowners in 2003. Like 2 Catalpa Road, the house contains rich woodwork, the product of Gilbane Construction Company’s master carpenter Iver Johnson.

  house-name: 'Clara P. and John T. Henthorn House'
  house-detail: '<i>1894</i><br>Owned by John and Ginger Harkey'
  house-description: | 
    90 Larch Street is a 2-family house constructed in 1894. It blends elements of several different forms and styles, including the Shingle, Queen Anne, and Colonial Revival. It is now a single-family house but retains its two original doors accessed via a porch on the principal elevation fronting Larch Street.
    
    The property was constructed in 1894 for John T. Henthorn, born in 1852 in Massachusetts, and his wife Clara P. Nicholls Henthorn, born in 1857 in New Hampshire. They had three children: John B., who worked as a calico printer, daughter Mabel, and son Joseph. John worked in Providence as a draughtsman and mechanical engineer before retiring in c. 1910. He died in 1914.
    
    From c. 1927 through his death in 1950, the house was owned by Stewart Campbell Cruickshank and his wife Jessie Ann Forbes Cruickshank. The pair were Canadian immigrants from Nova Scotia. Stewart worked as a house carpenter, contractor, and president/treasurer of S. C. Cruickshank, Inc while living on Larch Street. He worked alongside his son Herman. John W. Cruickshank, possibly Stewart’s brother or son, also lived in the house between 1927 and 1930 and worked as a “transit man.” Stewart died in 1950.
    
    Mildred and John R. Briden owned the house by the mid-1950s and into the early 1960s. John R. Briden worked as a salesman.
    
    It was used as a rental property beginning in the early 1960s. Ads from the mid-1960s reference garages for rent on site. The address is also referenced as a landlord or broker address in numerous apartment rental ads from the 1960s through the 1970s. Robert Hall Clothers was listed in the 1959 city directory and Pauline’s Dressmaking house in 1962 directory. While less is known about the property’s later history, it is significant as an early multi-family house. It represents the neighborhood’s later period of evolution and a different building type.
