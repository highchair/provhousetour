  house-detail:
  house-description: "The Paul Cuffee School’s charter was approved in 2000. It was named in honor of Captain Paul Cuffee, a Quaker businessman, whaler, and abolitionist of African and Wampanoag heritage, who founded what was perhaps the county’s first racially integrated school in Westport, MA in the late 18th century. In fall of 2001, the Paul Cuffee School opened in two rented locations in Providence with 136 K-3 students. By 2006 the School had a full middle school, encompassing grades 6, 7, and 8. In early August 2010 a former school building at 544 Elmwood Avenue became available for lease. Renovations began in earnest to ready the classrooms for a September opening. Today the Paul Cuffee School enrollment is 820 K-12 students, divided among three buildings identified as their Lower, Middle, and Upper Schools."

  house-name: 'Damase Bouchard Double House'
  house-detail: '<i>1911, Damase Bouchard, Builder</i><br>Owned by Dylan Peacock and Miki Kicić'
  house-description: |
    When Damase Bouchard acquired three lots on Congress Avenue, the location was one of the major selling points. Immediately off Elmwood Avenue and its busy trolley line linking the neighborhood with the central business district, the location was well-connected to city life. The properties had been owned by the Lewis T. and Sarah C. Downes estate at the time of its acquisition by Bouchard in October 1910 for the sum of $10.
    
    Damase was born in 1875 in San Mateo, California, to Octave and Philomene Bouchard. His parents were immigrants from Canada, arriving in the United States in the early 1860s. Damase was one of five children. He married Maria Gillmette on June 22, 1897. Together, Damase and Maria moved to Linwood Avenue, in the Elmwood neighborhood, and raised their family of five children. He went into business with his brother to create Bouchard Brothers & Sons, a contracting company responsible for the construction of numerous houses in the city.
    
    By the turn of the 20th century, Damase began to invest in real estate. The three lots that he acquired on Congress Avenue were for the purpose of building and renting apartments for additional income. He pulled permits in 1910 for three houses: 191-193 Congress Avenue, 197-199 Congress Avenue, and 209-211 Congress Avenue. The two matching houses at 191 and 197 Congress were built for approximately $6,500 each, while the double house at 209 Congress was built for approximately $9,000. This double house was one of three identical houses built in Providence, and is the only one to survive. One was demolished in the early 2000s, while a second house at 1043 Broad Street was demolished in August 2018.
    
    While there is no architect listed for the design of 209-211 Congress, it is likely that Damase Bouchard produced the plans from within his contracting firm. The overall mass of the house is symmetrical, with broad, flanking gables that are pierced in the front with a central gable. The house has numerous bay windows, matching covered entrance porches supported by Tuscan columns, and variations of dormers. An interesting interior detail, not commonly seen in double houses in Providence, is an internal light shaft placed in the center of the structure. It is topped with a skylight and offers diffused lighting to the stairwells in both residences. The stairwell contains multiple internal stained-glass windows that are illuminated during the daytime from the rooftop skylight.
    
    At 209 Congress, the Cook family took occupancy in 1911. Percy Ormond Cook was a traveling salesman, working in the dairy industry. He was born in Marlborough, Massachusetts, in 1872. His wife Lulu Burgess Cook was born in Rhode Island in 1880. The couple had a son, Ormond Burgess Cook, who was born in 1904. At the time of the recording of the Rhode Island State Census in 1915, the Cook family employed a servant, 26-year-old Margaret McCama.
    
    While the Cook family resided at 209 Congress for over 10 years, toward the end of their residency, the marriage between Percy and Lulu began to deteriorate. The archives of the Providence Journal indicate that in June of 1923 Lulu secured a lease at 380 Lloyd Avenue in Providence. By September, she petitioned for custody of their son, on the grounds that Percy “failed to provide.” Their estrangement took a final turn in January 1927, while Percy was traveling to Los Angeles. Despondent over the end of his marriage, Percy shot himself in his room at the Hotel Cecil – the notorious hotel made infamous in the Netflix docu-series “Crime Scene: The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel.” Lulu would later remarry, to paper goods manufacturer Robert Wilson Linton, and resided at 70 Wingate Road in Providence until her death in 1955.
    
    Businessman Charles Emerson Cohen and his wife Irma Levy were the first residents of 211 Congress in 1911. Charles was a co-founder of the financial credit company Caesar Misch, Inc. located in the [Caesar Misch Building](https://sah-archipedia.org/buildings/RI-01-PR34){:target="_blank"} on the corner of Westminster and Empire Streets, downtown. Charles was born in New York in 1870. His father was originally from Russia, and his mother from Prussia. He married Irma Levy of Galveston, Texas, in 1894. They did not have any children. Their residency at 211 Congress was relatively short, as the couple relocated to Galveston by 1920. 
    
    Damase Bouchard died in 1918, at which time the house was left to his wife Maria. By 1920, the house was owned by Damase’s uncle, also named Damase Bouchard, and his wife Eliza. The house would be sold out of the Bouchard family in 1922. By 1930, the house was owned by Emma Gingras and Rosanna Oullett. During their ownership, 209-211 Congress was turned into a boarding house, with the layout carved into small apartments for short-term occupancy, and multiple people residing there at various times. The property would remain in the Oullett family into the 1970s. A previous owner in the 1990s restored the house back into a two-family residence.
    
    The current homeowners acquired the property in 2015. Initially, the homeowners focused on a multitude of projects: removing and replacing the original boiler, refinishing the hardwood floors, making repairs to the original wood windows, and repairing numerous cracks in the plaster walls and ceilings. It has been a labor of love for the homeowners, who have filled their residence at 209 Congress with a blend of antiques and modern furniture. Most of the décor was acquired through various estate sales, online marketplaces, and from their travels. Future projects include replacing old plumbing and renovating the kitchen. The mother of one of the homeowners resides in 211 Congress. Her residence is an exact mirror image of the layout of 209 Congress.

  house-name: 'Mary E. and John A. Boyd House'
  house-detail: '<i>1904-1906, Fred E. Field, architect</i><br>Owned by Mike Seely and Hannah Dalton-Ameen '
  house-description: |
    In 1904, Joseph Cooke Smith and Adelaide W. Smith sold the parcel of land that would become 200 Congress Avenue to Mary Boyd and her husband John for the sum of $2,000.58. The deed lists Mary as the owner, a common practice for working families, likely to protect the family’s assets should John’s business as a pharmaceutical salesman happen to fail.
    
    The choice of Fred E. Field (1861-1931) as architect was likely determined after the Boyds’ neighbors at 202 Congress hired Field to design their house. For the Boyds, Field produced a handsome Colonial Revival residence, with a wide front porch featuring paired fluted Tuscan columns. The porch contains intricate leaded sidelights flanking the wide entrance door and a bay window. A notable feature of the façade is the central Palladian window on the pedimented gable. Field studied architecture at Cornell University and opened his practice in 1883. After years of private practice, Field joined prominent Providence architect Howard Hoppin in 1907, forming the firm [Hoppin & Field](https://guide.ppsri.org/designer/hoppin-field){:target="_blank"}. Following a period practicing in Orlando, Florida, Field returned to Providence, where he died in 1931.
    
    While 200 Congress was under construction, Mary and John were residing at 7 Bellevue Avenue, between Elmwood Avenue and Cromwell Street, as reflected in the Rhode Island Census of 1905. By the following year, they were residing at 200 Congress. The building permit, however, was pulled in 1904, with an estimated cost of $7,500 to construct the house. The Boyds’ residency at 200 Congress lasted only three short years, and in May 1909, Mary Boyd sold the house to Franklin L. Hall for $10. Hall, a bank clerk, moved into the house with his wife Bertha and their children William and Helen. In addition to the Hall family, the 1910 U.S. Census lists a 22-year-old Irish servant named Rose O’Neil residing at 200 Congress. By 1914, the house changed hands again, purchased by Susan S. Brayton.
    
    From 1914 until 1943, the house was owned by various members of the Brayton family. Susan Brayton was a public-school teacher. She resided at 200 Congress with her brother Edward R. and his wife Kate L. Brayton. Edward worked as a hardware salesman. While it is unknown if the Brayton family initially employed a domestic servant at 200 Congress Avenue, the 1910 U.S. Census lists an Irish servant named Margaret M. Fallon at the Brayton’s former residence at 95 Messer Street, in the city’s West End neighborhood. By 1918, ownership of the house was transferred to Susan’s brother Edward. In the 1920 U.S. Census, the Brayton household included Edward, age 53, his wife Kate, age 52, their son Randall, age 19, Edward’s sister Susan, age 55, and a 48-year-old servant named Annie S. Carlisle, who was born in Rhode Island. By 1930, after the death of Edward in 1926, the household included Kate’s mother and sister, Martha and Emma Adams, and a boarder named Agnes Jonas.
    
    In 1943, the house was sold to Edgardo “Edgar” Cianfarani and his wife Norma. Edgar worked as a hub and die cutter in the jewelry industry. He was born in Italy in 1899 and immigrated to the United States in 1921, arriving on Ellis Island on September 10. His brother Aristede Berto Cianfarani had first embarked to America to study sculpture at the Rhode Island School of Design, landing a job with the landmark **Gorham Manufacturing Company** in 1917. By 1919, Aristede moved to Meriden, Connecticut, to work for the International Silver Company. His works include a statue of cornet soloist Bowen R. Church, displayed in Providence’s Roger Williams Park, and “Henry the Navigator” on Eastern Avenue in Fall River, Massachusetts.
    
    In 1968, Edgar and his wife embarked on a renovation project at 200 Congress, converting the single-family house into a three-family residence. The blueprints from that project survive to this day. Edgar died in 1971, and his widow Norma sold the house to Susan Castrilli in 1975. After several more owners, the multi-family arrangements were reverted to a single-family residence in the early 2000s. By 2018, the house was sold to its current homeowners and stewards.
    
    Relocating to Providence from Somerville, Massachusetts, the couple was drawn to Elmwood by its architecture and the quality of its preservation efforts. They went straight to work on refurbishing their new home, starting with a new roof and HVAC systems. A major undertaking was a full remodel of the kitchen, designed by Kelly Taylor and built by Pete Deletka. For the homeowners, making an historic house function for their active lives with young children was paramount. The family has found a strong sense of community within Elmwood. On Congress Avenue in particular, there are many families with young children who often play together, adding to the vitality of the neighborhood.

  house-name: 'Maria E. and Carl E. Carlson House'
  house-detail: '<i>1922-1924, Carl E. Carlson, builder</i><br>Owned by Nicole and Leo Pollock'
  house-description: |
    The primary span of house construction in Elmwood began in about 1857 and had mostly concluded by 1930. At that point, many of the house lots had already been built upon, and only a handful of lots remained available throughout the neighborhood.
  
    Maria Carlson first acquired a lot on Congress Avenue in September 1915 from Joseph Cooke Smith. She would not construct anything on the lot for nearly seven years, retaining it for a future purpose. By 1917, Carlson had acquired the neighboring vacant lot to create a double urban lot on Congress Avenue, and she set out with her husband, contractor Carl Evald Carlson, to construct a home for their young family.
  
    No architect is listed on the building intentions, and it is likely that the house was built by Carl Carlson using a design from one of the many catalogs available. House catalogs, also known as pattern books or kit houses, were meant as a cost-effective way to construct a house. Companies such as Sears Roebuck, Gordon-Van Tine, Bennett Homes, Tumwater Lumber Mills Co., Montgomery Ward, and Aladdin Homes were some of the leading producers of kit houses in the country.
  
    A traditional Colonial Revival, the home is rectangular, with a kitchen ell to the rear and a symmetrical façade topped with a hipped roof. The entrance portico is unusual as it features fluted, square Doric columns supporting corbeled rafter tails commonly seen on pergolas. An enclosed sun porch overlooks the large side and back yards. On the interior, a center-hall staircase leads to a landing with a large stained-glass window. The woodwork throughout is traditional, keeping to Colonial Revival ideals. An unusually narrow service staircase (now removed) connected the kitchen with the landing on the main staircase. A permit was issued for the construction of the house in May 1922. Another permit was issued in December of the same year for the construction of the adjacent garage.
  
    Carl Carlson was born in 1878 in Sweden. He and his parents immigrated to the United States in 1898. Maria, whose maiden name is Larson, was born in Sweden in 1886. Immigration records indicate that Maria was born Maria Elisabet Larsdotter. She and Carl would marry on September 1, 1908. At the time of their occupancy of 186 Congress, the Carlsons had two children, Arthur and Eleanor. By the time of the recording of the 1930 U.S. Census, the household included a third child, Robert and a housemaid, 26-year-old Beatrice Carroll from Northern Ireland.
  
    After the Carlsons sold the house in 1945, the family relocated to Foxborough, Massachusetts. Their home at 186 Congress was sold to Edward and Eleanor Ciocys. The house remained in the Ciocys family until 1980, when it was sold to Dennis M. Coleman and his wife, Miriam Curtis. The current homeowners acquired the property in 2018.
  
    With a desire to remain in Providence and the need for a large yard, the current homeowners sought property in Elmwood due to its affordability and the quality of the houses in the neighborhood. The yard proved to be the right size, with enough space to entertain and to create a large vegetable and herb garden. Of the numerous projects undertaken by the homeowners, the garage conversion was the largest. While retaining the original garage doors and sealing them, the interior has been converted into an in-law apartment, complete with full kitchen, bathroom, sleeping and living space, and other modern amenities. A recent kitchen remodel, designed entirely by the homeowners, features locally cut walnut on the cabinets and windowsills. During the COVID-19 pandemic, projects included repainting the wood trim, adding lighting where needed, and restoring the fireplace.
  
    After moving to Elmwood, the homeowners and their young children have found themselves in a tight-knit community. Their neighbors, also with young children, often get together for social gatherings and backyard events. The homeowners love the sense of community in Elmwood. They consider themselves to be incredibly fortunate to be part of the next generation of families that have called Elmwood home."

  house-name: 'Robert A. Jenckes House'
  house-detail: '<i>1901, Edwin T. Banning, architect</i><br>Owned by Alana Bibeau and David Leveillee'
  house-description: |  
    In June 1900, Robert and Jessie Jenckes acquired property on what was then known as Winchester Place from Joseph Cooke Smith for the sum of $2,072.67. The surrounding neighborhood was quickly filling with lavishly appointed residences for the city’s burgeoning middle-class residents. In 1901, Winchester Place was renamed Ontario Street. With a desire to build an appropriate house for their family, the Jenckeses turned to architect [Edwin T. Banning](https://guide.ppsri.org/designer/e-t-banning){:target="_blank"}.
    
    Edwin Thomas Banning (1864-1940) was born in Danielson, Connecticut, to Rev. Carlos and Harriet Pitman Banning. Upon his family’s move to Rhode Island, Edwin dropped out of school and began work as a draftsman with Providence architects Thomas Gould and Frank Angell at their prominent firm, [Gould & Angell](https://guide.ppsri.org/designer/gould-angell){:target="_blank"}. By the mid-1890s, Banning set up an office in downtown Providence. His 1896 design submission for the new Casino at Roger Williams Park was met with favorable reviews, which ultimately landed him the commission. Banning’s growing portfolio of public buildings is likely what drew in Robert and Jessie Jenckes when it was time to hire an architect for their house. By 1903, Banning partnered with his brother-in-law Henry C. Thornton to create the firm [Banning & Thornton](https://guide.ppsri.org/designer/banning-thornton){:target="_blank"}, which primarily designed schools, as well as fire houses and churches. In 1903, the firm designed Temple Beth-El, an Elmwood landmark located at 688 Broad Street. The firm was also responsible for the 1906 Humboldt Avenue Fire Station. Both of these structures have appeared on the Providence Preservation Society’s annual Most Endangered Properties List.
    
    For 170 Ontario Street, Banning delivered a handsome Colonial Revival residence for the Jenckes family. The entrance faces the side lawn and is accessed by the expansive wraparound porch. The porch itself is supported by Tuscan-inspired posts, with the space pierced by bay windows and the corner pavilion. An unusual surface treatment of pressed stone in cement can be found on the porch’s ceiling as well as the undersides of the house’s eaves. This treatment, sometimes referred to as pebbledash when placed vertically as a wall surface, adds texture and an interesting decorative detail seen mostly with Colonial Revival houses.
    
    On the inside, the floor plan lends itself beautifully to an active family. The entrance hall also serves as the primary living space. A central fireplace is situated between the entrance area and the living room, both with large bay windows. The main staircase connects with the service stairs at the landing, which allows access to the kitchen. The dining room is immediately adjacent to the main entrance, separating the living area from the kitchen.
    
    In the 1910 U.S. Census, the Jenckes household included Robert, age 44, his wife Jessie, age 38, and their children, Ernest and Malcolm. The family shared their home with a 25-year-old Swedish servant named Ellen Simgen, who immigrated to the United States in 1903. A bedroom on the third floor of the house – a common feature in many of the houses in Elmwood – was used by Ellen.
    
    The Jenckes family would live at 170 Ontario for more than 30 years. Robert died in 1931, and his widow Jessie sold the house to the O’Hara family in 1936. The O’Hara family was quite large. In the 1940 U.S. Census, the household included: Hannah T., a 57-year-old teacher, sister Margaret – 48, with no listed occupation – sister Mary V., a 45-year-old teacher, sister Sara H., a 58-year-old private accountant, sister Loretta C., a 42-year-old music teacher, and brother Thomas M., a 63- year-old tool maker. The extended O’Hara family resided at 170 Ontario until it was sold to Charles F. Gormley and his wife Joan in 1976.
    
    The current owners purchased the home in 2018 from the Gormley family, relocating from Warwick with a desire to raise their children in a diverse urban neighborhood. Since acquiring the house, the family has made small changes, in particular renovating an upstairs bathroom. Though original construction documents are a rarity for homes of this age, the homeowners received the original set of blueprints as a gift from the previous owners. During the COVID-19 pandemic, family members greatly utilized all spaces of the house, enjoying afternoons on the second-floor porch. They also focused on restoring all of the original brass hardware throughout.

  house-name: 'George H. Miner House'
  house-detail: '<i>1891, no known architect/builder</i><br>Owned by Jim Barnes and Victoria Wilson'
  house-description: |
    The opening of Gorham Manufacturing’s Elmwood complex in 1890 brought an increased demand for housing in the vicinity of the company’s factory. With an eye for both rental income and a residence for his eventual retirement, Reverend George H. Miner acquired land on the corner of Melrose and Ontario Streets in October 1890 from the estate of William S. Humphrey.
    
    By June of the following year, work was underway to build a house on the lot. While no architect is listed, the house was likely chosen from a pattern book of house plans – catalogs of designs created by architects from across the country with no specific clients in mind. Architects such as George F. Barber and David S. Hopkins, though not located in Rhode Island, published their plans in magazines. Clients would send payment to the architects for their chosen design. The architects would then produce a set of official blueprints and building specs for their clients, who would source local contractors to build from the plans. In some cases, architects would go as far as to include a catalog of fixtures, including stained-glass windows, door hardware, light fixtures, sinks, and even toilets. The practice created a sense of “one-stop shopping” for prospective homeowners who were looking to simplify the process of building a home and keep costs relatively low. The house at 84 Melrose closely resembles Design No. 53 from the book Houses and Cottages, by Grand Rapids, Michigan-based architect David S. Hopkins.
    
    Reverend George H. Miner was originally from North Stonington, Connecticut. He attended Brown University, graduating from the school in 1863. He was installed at a Baptist church in North Stonington the following year, when he also married Abbie Frances Butts of Providence. Together, they had two children, Lillian and George L. Miner. Rev. Miner was a descendant – 8th generation – of Lieutenant Thomas Miner, the founder of Stonington Connecticut. He was also a descendant – 17th generation – of Henry Miner of Somerset England, who was knighted by King Edward III in 1339. Reverend Miner served in various churches throughout New England over the course of his life; he was the pastor of the Second Baptist Church in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the Green Street Baptist Church in Newburyport, Massachusetts, the First Baptist Church in New Britain, Connecticut, and the Cranston Street Baptist Church in Providence. Occasionally, he would preach at the Calvary Baptist Church located on Broad Street in Providence.
    
    The first occupant of 84 Melrose was Charles T. Main, a mill engineer who worked at Gorham Manufacturing. He moved into the house in 1892, but by 1894, the house was occupied by George H. Miner and his wife. Miner had retired from the ministry in 1893. The Miners resided on Melrose Street for approximately eight years. In 1901, the family traveled abroad for two years and rented out 84 Melrose to Willis S. Pino, who owned a seed and florist shop at 277 Washington Street. The Miners settled in Newburyport in 1903 and remained there until relocating once again to Mystic, Connecticut, in 1907. They sold the house to Willis Pino in 1909 for the sum of $100 and other considerations. The house would remain in the Pino family until 1967.
    
    When the house was acquired by its current owners – both architects – in 2003, they were drawn to Elmwood because of its great diversity and the quality of its architecture. They focused on cosmetics, having the exterior repainted, woodwork refinished, replacing kitchen cabinets, and adding a master bathroom in what was a smaller bedroom. The house is filled with various antiques, once belonging to the homeowner’s mother and great aunt from Brooklyn, New York. Of particular interest is the faux wood painted columns – known as trompe l’oeil – separating the living room from the dining room, and the angled double fireplaces in the entrance hall and dining room.
    
    The house has become part of the homeowners’ lives as they have worked to make it functional for modern needs. In July 2004, the homeowners married in its garden. They have become deeply involved in the community for which Elmwood is known. Their walks up and down its streets, meeting their neighbors, viewing the array of quality houses, and attending neighborhood gatherings has greatly enhanced their experience of living in Elmwood.

  house-detail: '<i>1891; additions 1904, 1905, no known architect; A.M. Anderson, builder for 1905 addition</i><br>Owned by Brooke Hammerle'
  house-description: |
    With the opening of Gorham Manufacturing’s Elmwood complex in 1890, demand sharply rose for housing to accommodate factory workers and various other employees of the prominent silver company. Many of the available lots east of Melrose Street began to fill with multi-family dwellings, ranging from double houses and tenement flats to triple-deckers. Typically, the owner lived in one of the apartments. For James E. Taylor and his wife Kate, the affordability of land and its proximity to both transit and James’s employer made Elmwood the right area in which to build.
    
    The couple acquired the land on Ontario Street in the same year that Gorham’s factory opened and constructed a modest Colonial Revival double house, slightly elevated above the street. The house was initially built without a front porch and featured a hip roof lined with a simple balustrade. The two sides of the house were mirror-copies of each other, with both featuring a rear bay window in the dining room.
    
    Building permits at Providence City Hall indicate that the Taylors added the “piazza,” or front porch, in 1904. That addition is rather handsome, with Tuscan posts and a projected entrance, topped with a shared balcony. Another addition was built the following year, creating what would be the present-day kitchen ell in the rear, for the sum of $1,000.
    
    At 140 Ontario, the Taylor household included James, age 46, his wife Kate, age 42, their children T. Henry and Grace, James’s mother Sarah, age 69, and a 74-year-old boarder named Chad Burlingame. In the U.S. Census of 1900, James is listed as a burnisher of silver, likely employed at Gorham. Their tenants in 142 Ontario were the Pike family. Austin Pike is listed as a foreman at Gorham. In fact, many other residents on Ontario Street are listed as working in the silver industry, likely at Gorham, where the payroll included hundreds of workers.
    
    Sometime in 1905, James passed away and the estate was placed into the control of his widow Kate. By 1909, the house was sold to John Phillips of Mystic, Connecticut. The house changed hands several times over the course of its history. From 1919 until 1946, it was owned by the Regan-Keeffe family. In 1948, while owned by Benjamin Paris, modifications were made that converted 142 Ontario into a two-family unit, leaving the former Taylor apartment at 140 Ontario as a single-family unit. Benjamin Paris was a mail carrier who worked at the Elmwood Post Office. When he and his wife Edith acquired the house in 1946, the mortgage was held through the Providence Postal Workers Union for $6,000. The Parises were members of Broad Street’s Temple Beth-El, and their son Paul would later serve as president of the synagogue, as well as being a board member of the Jewish Home for the Aged and Miriam Hospital.
    
    The current owner purchased the house in 1983. At the time, Elmwood was experiencing the beginnings of a socio-economic shift that would see the revitalization of the neighborhood over the next 30 years. The homeowner was an early member of the Elmwood Foundation, a neighborhood organization that sought to create a sense of community within Elmwood while also focusing on restoring and rehabilitating its historic houses. As an artist who came to Providence to study at the Rhode Island School of Design, she has filled her home with various pieces of her own work, ranging from paintings to multi-media works containing glass and paint. The artwork complements the owner’s collection of mid-century furniture, adding a modern element to her historic Colonial Revival house.

  house-description: |
    Frank E. Farnham purchased two lots of land on Ontario Street from the estate of the late William Humphrey in June 1898. The double-lot acquisition was rare, especially in the blocks east of Melrose Street, where the lots filled rapidly with multi-family housing. The purchase gave Farnham a 10,000 square foot lot in the middle of a growing urban neighborhood.
    
    With a need to construct a residence for his family, Farnham turned to the catalogs produced by architect George Franklin Barber of Knoxville, Tennessee. George Barber (1854-1915) was originally from DeKalb, Illinois, and had worked as a carpenter, builder, and even horticulturist. Barber drafted numerous house designs to be included in a series of catalogs. Some designs were also featured in various magazines such as Scientific American and The American Architect. Clients could view renderings, floor plans, as well as descriptions of the designs and the estimated costs. Once a design was chosen, the clients would send payment for an official set of blueprints that would be used to construct a house. This allowed clients to control the costs associated with building a house, while enjoying the convenience of a simplified construction process. For 120 Ontario, the design is referred to as “Design No. 56,” though it is unknown which catalog the design originated from.
    
    The house is a quintessential Queen Anne with an abundance of decorative detail. From the welcoming wraparound entrance porch with its corner gazebo, to the array of materials and their textures, there is much to experience with this house. The walls are covered in clapboards on the ground floor, while the upper floor retains a combination hex and “square butt” pattern in wood shingles. The gables are also decorated with carved and applied moldings, including a cartouche, on their bargeboards. The property features a garage, likely added in the 1920s, which complements the design of the house.
    
    At 120 Ontario, the Farnham household included Frank, his wife Nellie F. Bunker, and their two daughters Gladys and Ethel. Frank’s mother Ella moved in with her son and his family shortly after the house was finished. As a toolmaker and jeweler, Frank helped to enhance the trade through two patents held by him, all relating to the design of jewelry pins. He served as president and chairman of the Jewelry Supply Co. The Farnham family were members of the Plymouth Congregational Church located at 1014 Broad Street. When the congregation, one of the largest Protestant parishes in Providence, was seeking to build a new house of worship in the 1910s, Frank served as chairman of the Building Committee. The new church was constructed in 1915-1919, designed by Boston architect George F. Newton. After Frank’s death in 1943, his widow Nellie donated a large representational stained-glass window to the church in memory of her late husband. The window depicted the Resurrection of Christ and was designed by Hiemer & Co. of New Jersey. Today, the church is the Iglesia Visiόn Evangélica.
    
    The Farnham house was sold to Winfield Hunt and his wife Elizabeth in 1942. The house was turned into two apartments in the 1950s and remained in this configuration until it was restored in the 1980s. Incidentally, a fire of unknown origin swept through the house in March, 1976, causing structural damage. The house was also featured in a September, 2007 edition of the Providence Journal as a “House of the Week.” The article detailed the original fixtures and well-maintained condition of the house.
    
    The current owners relocated to Providence from Vancouver seven years ago. Their careers drew them to the city, and the affordability and character of the neighborhood brought them to Elmwood. Throughout their ownership of 120 Ontario, they have focused on updating the house to fit their decorative tastes and giving the exterior a paint scheme befitting its exuberant details. In the living room, the couple added a period chandelier found at an antique warehouse in Hudson, New York. The original woodwork in the dining room was refinished. Like many people during the COVID-19 pandemic, the homeowners undertook a “pandemic project,” which meant refreshing the front parlor to become the “Blue Room.” Their current project will focus on updating the kitchen, which was last remodeled in the early 2000s by a previous owner. Their stewardship of the property has allowed the house to remain an important architectural landmark in Elmwood. The homeowners enjoy being part of the diverse and eclectic neighborhood with its maintained houses and vibrant preserved history.

  house-name: 'Martha and J. William Critchley House'
  house-detail: '<i>1899, D. Howard Thornton, architect</i><br>Owned by Erica Busillo Adams and Samuel W. Adams'
  house-description: |
    Martha Critchley acquired property on Adelaide Avenue in March of 1899. Both she and her husband, taxidermist J. William Critchley, were immigrants to the United States. Though they did not have any children, the couple looked to set down roots in Providence.
    
    William was born in England in 1862. His family immigrated to this country the following year, arriving at Ellis Island on December 21, 1863. Martha was born in France in 1862 and immigrated in 1871, marrying William the same year. William was a naturalist and studied osteology and the art of taxidermy. His work became well-known over the course of his career. In 1891, The Providence Journal wrote about the practice of taxidermy and described the work that Critchley performed, including the stuffing of Jumbo, an elephant from the Barnum & Bailey Circus. In 1901, during Theodore Roosevelt’s first term as President, Critchley was hired to stuff a cougar killed by Roosevelt on a recent hunting trip.
    
    After acquiring the land on Adelaide Avenue in 1899, the Critchleys sought to build a house solely for rental income. Their residence at the time was 15 Green Street, located on Weybosset Hill, on the outskirts of downtown Providence. The couple chose D. Howard Thornton to design a modest house in the Dutch Colonial Revival style. This gambrel-roofed style was popular throughout Providence, and the leading firm in the city – [Angell & Swift](https://guide.ppsri.org/designer/angell-swift){:target="_blank"} – produced a multitude of such villas for patrons from Providence to Fall River, Massachusetts. Colonial Revivals are known for their eclectic fusion of elements, all derived from variations of 16th, 17th, and early 18th century architecture. Situated tightly between its neighbors, 194 Adelaide has an entrance on its side, accessed by a long covered porch lined in Tuscan columns. The form is charming and visually pleasing; a bay window faces Adelaide, and dormers with varying roof styles line the lower slopes of the gambrel.
    
    The first tenants of 194 Adelaide were restaurant owner Henry Stewart Wolfe and his family. Wolfe owned a popular diner in downtown Providence. The Wolfe household, as of the 1900 U.S. Census, included Henry, age 30, his wife Amy, age 26, their daughter Hazel, age 3, and Amy’s mother, Lucy Hendrick, age 51. By 1903, Henry Wolfe purchased 194 Adelaide when the Critchleys relocated to Brooklyn, New York, and William accepted the position as chief taxidermist at the Museum of Brooklyn Institute of Arts & Sciences.
    
    The Wolfe family lived at 194 Adelaide for over four decades. The house was the setting for the wedding reception of their daughter, Hazel LaForge Wolfe, upon her marriage to James Joseph Barry of Middletown, Connecticut, on January 17, 1920. After Henry’s death in January 1934, his widow Amy converted some of the bedrooms into a rental apartment.
    
    The house sold in 1946, after which it was witness to a revolving door of tenants, as well as a shift in the socio-economic state of Elmwood. By the 1950s, the house had been carved into three apartments. Ownership of 194 Adelaide changed frequently after 1967, with out-of-town landlords using it for rental income. The archives of the Providence Journal also list a series of notable disturbances at 194 Adelaide. One particular situation unfolded in April 1988, when a tenant found that her two Siamese cats, a food bowl, and a bag of cat food had been stolen from the house.
    
    By the 1990s, the house was owned by Luis Vargas, who worked to remove the apartments and convert the structure back into a single-family residence. In 2018, the current homeowners acquired the house. Their stewardship of the property has focused on refinishing woodwork, updating the electrical systems, and correcting improper repairs made over the years by previous owners. The family was drawn to Elmwood by the diversity of its residents, the architecture of its homes, and the vibrancy of the thriving and engaging community it has become.

  house-name: 'John S. Tripp, Jr. House '
  house-detail: '<i>c. 1878, unknown architect/builder</i><br>Owned by Cathy Lund and Peter Karczmar'
  house-description: |
    Adelaide Avenue, named after the first wife of Joseph Jesse Cooke, was established in the 1850s in what was then a part of Cranston. The Cookes owned a large farm named Elmwood, and the neighborhood that later came to be established there shared the name. Joseph Cooke opened a private park within his farm, known as Adelaide Grove, along what is now the block between present-day Adelaide, Elmwood, and Lenox Avenues. Open to the public by invitation, the park featured well-kept trees and shrubs, with lawns meant for picnicking by visitors. The land around the park, however, was steadily parceled off for sale.
    
    After the town boundary lines were redrawn in 1868 and Elmwood returned to Providence, demand for available housing lots was so strong that Cooke’s descendants eventually sold off the lots with specific land restrictions, meant to control development. One parcel of land across from Adelaide Grove was sold to John Salisbury Tripp and William B. Allen in 1871.
    
    The parcel of land owned by John Tripp was sold to his son, John Jr., and a house was constructed there in 1878. The exact year is known only through the tax ledgers, which record a house valued at $5,000 situated on the lot. While no architect or builder is listed, the house was likely the product of a local architect. The house, an eclectic display of Italianate and Queen Anne architecture, is the first of the large homes to be built along Adelaide Avenue. The structure is square in form, but with a semi-octagonal pavilion, from which rises a dramatic turret and a panel brick chimney. The turret and its steep candle snuffer roof, along with an oriel bay window on the front façade, are the defining features of the house. Interestingly, the National Register of Historic Places inventory forms for the Elmwood Historic District identify the house as Second Empire in style; however, the structure has a broad-hipped roof, rather than a traditional mansard, and the turret evokes Queen Anne stylistic details.
    
    John S. Tripp, Jr. and his family lived at 225 Adelaide for only three years. In the 1880 U.S. Census, the household included John, then 36 years old, his wife Julia, age 32, and their children Fred, Annie, and Ben. Tripp is listed as a merchant tailor, and the house directories of the time indicate that his workshop was located at 75 Weybosset Street in the central business district.
    
    In its earliest years, 225 Adelaide transferred several times. In 1881, the house was sold to Ada Vaughan, wife of Benjamin Vaughan, a cotton goods manufacturer. Benjamin Vaughan is listed as director of several outfits in Providence, including serving as vice president of the National Bank of North America. The Vaughans, like the Tripp family, lived at 225 Adelaide for just three years. By 1884, the house was under the ownership of William H. Perry, a scrap iron dealer.
    
    In January 1898, the house was purchased by Effie and Arthur Peck. By November of the same year, it was acquired by Rudolph Berry. Berry was the owner of the Vesta Knitting Mills, located at 2 Imperial Place in the Jewelry District. His company manufactured ribbed, knitted hosiery and underwear, while his factories also supplied working studios for the thriving jewelry manufacturing industry. The U.S. Census in 1900 lists the occupants of 225 Adelaide as Rudolph Berry, age 47, his wife Fannie, age 37, and a servant named Bessie Sharkey, age 19. Bessie was born in Ireland and immigrated to the United States in 1896.
    
    The archives of The Providence Journal detail additional happenings at 225 Adelaide during the Berrys’ residency. In 1902, a small chimney fire caused minor damage to the house. The following year, the Berrys were mourning the loss of their daughter, whose funeral was held at 225 Adelaide. By 1904, the house was sold once again to Eliza Dean, who previously lived at 228 Atlantic Avenue, also on this year’s tour.
    
    Eliza Dean and her husband Calvin would live at 225 Adelaide for many years. The ownership of the house was placed under Eliza, rather than Calvin, to protect the family’s assets should Calvin’s business as a jeweler fail. This practice was not uncommon in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Dean household, as of the recording of the 1910 U.S. Census, included Calvin, age 50, his wife Eliza, age 50, their children Bessie and Forrest, Calvin’s mother Adeline, age 78, and a 25-year-old servant named Annie Dredge. Annie was born in New York in 1885, the daughter of Welsh and Irish immigrants. Sadly, Calvin’s mother Adeline died in 1914. Her funeral was held at 225 Adelaide on November 19, 1914. Eliza died two years later. By 1921, Calvin had auctioned off the contents of the house and the property was sold to Fred Horton.
    
    The current owners acquired 225 Adelaide in 1994, drawn to the neighborhood by its extravagant architecture, tree-lined streets, and a strong sense of community that has only grown stronger over the past 30 years. Neighborhood get-togethers are a regular occurrence along Adelaide Avenue, whether to help rescue a neighbor’s lost parrot or to gather on the porch to enjoy cocktails in the summer afternoons.
    
    The homeowners have filled 225 Adelaide with an incredible collection of Victorian and mid- century modern furnishings. To complement the space, the walls are adorned with artwork by local artists such as Mark Freedman and Kathy Hodge. Most of the artwork, however, was created by one of the homeowners herself. The couple’s collection of taxidermy, including the lion in the sunroom and the giraffe in the living room, are wonderful surprises that seamlessly fit into the decor.
    
    From September 2000 until March 2001, Elmwood was in the spotlight through Bob Vila’s popular television show Home Again, in which the builder worked with neighborhood residents to tackle various home projects. One of those projects took place at 225 Adelaide, as Vila and his team worked with the homeowners to reconstruct the roof of the sunroom to support a jacuzzi tub and a deck.
    
    Shortly after the homeowners acquired 225 Adelaide, they were met with the difficult decision to cut a majestic old oak tree, likely planted by the Tripp family. Rather than discard the wood, the couple had the oak quarter sawn into boards and placed into storage. Many years later, when the kitchen was being renovated, the boards were pulled from storage and repurposed as kitchen cabinets, a meaningful way for the homeowners to honor the family that originally built their residence.
    
    The Tripp House, having stood longer than many houses in Elmwood, is a marvelous landmark of a time when the neighborhood was quickly changing from rural farmland to the city’s first suburb. Its owners over nearly one and a half centuries have been loving stewards to the house, each adding their own piece to its history.

  house-name: 'Thomas Wickens House'
  house-detail: '<i>1894-1895, James McGregor, builder</i>'
  house-description: |
    Thomas Wickens and his wife Mary relocated from Providence’s Mount Hope neighborhood to Elmwood with their daughter Elizabeth in 1895, when their new home at 228 Atlantic Avenue was completed. Thomas was a machinist at [Brown & Sharpe Manufacturing Company](https://guide.ppsri.org/property/brown-sharpe-manufacturing-co){:target="_blank"}, a major outfit in Providence along the Woonasquatucket River. The firm manufactured clocks, watches, and light precision tools. Thomas was a member of the Brown & Sharpe Mutual Relief Association, as well as a member of the Methodist Social Union.
    
    The Wickens family first purchased their lot on Atlantic Avenue in 1891 for $100. By 1894, a building permit was issued to construct a “2-story, wood, single-family house” with an estimated cost of $4,000. Thomas hired local builder James McGregor to construct the house. No architect is listed; however, it is likely that the plans for the house were purchased from a magazine or catalog of house plans. This practice was becoming increasingly popular for middle-class citizens wishing to keep costs down.
    
    The Wickens family occupied 228 Atlantic until 1902. During their residency, daughter Elizabeth ran her own business out of the house as a piano instructor. After the house was sold in May 1902, the family relocated to 47 Wood Street in the Armory District. Thomas died in 1906 at age 70, but his widow Mary and daughter Elizabeth continued to live at 47 Wood for many years. Their house at 228 Atlantic was acquired by Eliza Dean, wife of jeweler Calvin Dean. Curiously, the house was transferred to Simeon Sweet one month later in June 1902.
    
    Simeon Sweet was a lumber dealer. He and his wife Martha would reside at 228 Atlantic for the next 12 years. In the 1910 U.S. Census, the home’s occupants included Simeon, age 70, his wife Martha, 65, and a 24-year-old servant named Annie Jordan, who had immigrated to the United States from Northern Ireland in 1905. Martha Sweet died in August 1914, and Simeon died two months later. The house remained in the Sweet family until it was sold in 1921. It was sold again in 1930 to the Toye family, who lived at 228 Atlantic until 1968.
    
    The current owners acquired the house in 2012 and immediately went to work freshening the interiors, restoring the exterior, and making 228 Atlantic their cherished home. The couple has focused on restoring the house’s original wood windows, refinishing much of the original woodwork, adding period and modern light fixtures, and applying a dazzling array of color throughout. A labor of love is evident in their stewardship of this 128-year-old gem.
