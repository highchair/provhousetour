<p><i>Homeowners: Hilary Fagan and Al Dahlberg</i></p>
<p>The youngest house in this year’s festival lineup is the 1928 Harold Stone House. Stone was a salesman, who had his gable-ended house constructed in the Colonial Revival style. The late-period house features simple detailing, a break from the neighborhood’s earlier Second Empire and Queen Anne houses. </p>
<p>A later resident was John Congdon, Jr and his wife Adeline. Congdon was vice president of Congdon &amp; Carpenter, a steel manufacturer that operated in Providence well into the 1980s. In the early 1960s, the Congdons added a bomb shelter to the home. </p>
<p>The current owners have filled their home with numerous family pieces. The art collection was assembled by the owner’s uncle, Robert Fagan, through various auctions in New York City in the 1970s and ’80s. In the living room stands a late-18th/early-19th century bureau that was purchased by the owner’s paternal grandparents in Paris in the 1920s. A small wooden side table was a gift to the owner’s maternal grandparents from Representative Herbert Claiborne Pell. </p>
