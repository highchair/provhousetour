      <h2 class="h3">Welcome, from our Executive Director</h2>
      
<p class="lead">Welcome to the Providence Preservation Society’s 39th Festival of Historic Houses! The Festival is a great way to learn about Providence’s history and architecture, and to visit our wonderful neighborhoods.</p>

<p>As the site of this year’s Festival, the hidden enclave of Paterson Park is well-worth exploring any time of year. It was founded for middle-class professionals who needed ready access to a trolley line and also didn’t want to be far from nature. Its houses are generous yet cozy, well-appointed in their architectural details, and infused with enough contemporary updates to welcome new homeowners. </p>

<p>One of the neighborhood’s best features is its proximity to the Wayland Square commercial area, where you’ll find local boutiques and national retailers, a diversity of dining options and two independent book stores. Be sure to spend some time there before or after your tour.</p>

<p>And on Sunday — Father’s Day — join us for thematic walking tours of the Wayland neighborhood, just west of Paterson Park. Learn about young H.P. Lovecraft and the tragic figure of Gladys Potter, as well as how the abundant and historic green spaces are now being conserved for all of us to enjoy. </p>

<p>In 2017, we went “green” by creating this guide map in place of our usual guidebook. We invite you to use your web browser to visit <a href="//providencehousetour.com/2019/">providencehousetour.com/2019</a> on your mobile device. There, you’ll find complete house histories and more. If you use social media, I encourage you to share your experience by posting photos <strong><i>(no indoor photos, please!)</i></strong> with the hashtag <strong>#pvdpreservation</strong> and tag us <strong>@pvdpreservation</strong>. Let the world know how much beauty and history we have here in Providence! </p>

<p>Thank you again for supporting PPS’s efforts to improve the Providence by advocating for historic preservation and the enhancement of the city’s unique character through thoughtful design and planning. </p>

<p><i>See you on the tour!</i></p>

<p>Brent Runyon<br>
Executive Director</p>
