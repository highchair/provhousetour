    <p class=lead"">PPS welcomes you to our <b>Festival of Gardens</b>, presented in collaboration with The Garden Conservancy. We’re excited to be together with our community again after a year spent in online meeting rooms. The opportunity to unite in celebration of Providence’s special places has always been the goal of our Festival of Historic Houses. This year, in order to ensure we are meeting the latest public health guidance, we have created a special, open-air experience for you.</p>
    <p>The <b>Festival of Gardens</b> is a celebration of urban landscapes, an integral part of what makes Providence a wonderful place to live, work, recreate, and explore! These landscapes give us the room to breathe, watch the sky, toss a ball, or cultivate gardens. They also root us in the history of Providence, because the spaces between buildings can be as important as the buildings themselves. The gardens you will explore today are located on the ancestral territory of the Narragansett nation, whose living legacy is sustained by the descendants that make this state their home. PPS acknowledges that our work throughout Providence and Rhode Island takes place on their traditional lands.</p>
    <p>We are grateful to those who have graciously opened their gardens for this year’s Festival. Each is proud of the role their landscape plays in the current life and past history of our community. For instance, the Peace and Plenty Garden, established in the 1980s, is farmed by more than 40 families and neighborhood organizations using organic practices to raise traditional crops from around the world. Free produce is available to community members experiencing food insecurity. On the other side of town, the Colonial Revival garden at Shakespeare’s Head, designed in the 1930s to evoke the colonial period in which the house was constructed, provides the public with a tucked away greenspace for rest and reflection.</p>
    <p>If you are visiting from out of town, please use the <a href="//www.goprovidence.com" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">GoProvidence website</a> to find places to grab a meal or a cocktail, do a little shopping, or learn more about our city’s rich heritage. Providence has a lot to offer, and our Festival will take you through many of its wonderful neighborhoods, including Blackstone, the West End, and Elmwood. And, of course, you’ll be visiting Benefit Street, one of America’s most historic streets, which we call our “Mile of History.”</p>
    <p>We’re excited you’re here and hope you enjoy the weekend! If you’re interested in supporting the organization that has a considerable influence on the preservation and revitalization of Providence, we welcome you to <a href="//ppsri.org/membership" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">become a member</a> of the Providence Preservation Society. Your support will help us continue our work to preserve and enhance Providence’s unique character through thoughtful design and planning. And you will get early access to future event tickets. </p>
    <p>Enjoy the tour!<br>
