    <p>The Colonial Revival-style Wesley C. Martin House (1911) at 290 Blackstone Boulevard is a contributing property in the Blackstone Boulevard-Cole Avenue-Grotto Avenue Historic District. The house includes hallmarks of the Colonial Revival style, such as an emphasized principal entrance and elliptical pediments. The front door includes interesting crown glass lights, referencing the hand-blown glass technique popular in the colonial period. </p>
    <p>The garden at the Martin House includes long-established rhododendrons and mossy scenes ornamented with sculpture by internationally recognized glass artist Howard Ben Tré and sculptors Jonathan Bonner and Gilbert Franklin. Next door, a functional garden, affectionately dubbed the “Blackstone Boulevard Farm,” includes vegetable beds, fruit trees, a hops trellis, beehives, and sculpture by stone carver Tracy Mahaffey.</p>
