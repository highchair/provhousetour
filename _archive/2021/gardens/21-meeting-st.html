    <p>The John Carter House (1772) has been known as “Shakespeare’s Head” since the 18th century. A sign depicting William Shakespeare identified the house as the publishing location of The Providence Gazette. The building has seen a myriad of uses since the 18th century and has housed a post office, shop, and residence. The five-bay Georgian house includes a gabled pediment with Doric pilasters, emphasizing the principal entrance on Meeting Street. </p>
    <p>Spearheaded by the Shakespeare’s Head Association, the well-known Colonial Revival gardens behind the house were designed in the 1930s by landscape architect James Graham to evoke the period in which the house was constructed. Since then, the gardens have continuously evolved under the thoughtful stewardship of local volunteers. Providence Preservation Society acquired the house and gardens in 2015. Today, the gardens contain varieties of roses, ferns, shrubs, perennials, and deciduous trees.</p>
