    <p>Built by the early 1770s, the house at 27 Cushing Street was moved to its present location in 1857. It is known as “The Powder House” in reference to its historical uses storing gunpowder and serving as a coachman’s house for the nearby Sampson and Eliza Almy House (75 Prospect Street). Its colorful history is rumored to include additional uses as a cadet house and an alarm post for troops to assemble in the event of an emergency. Notable architectural features include a porch with arched lattice and delicate spindle-work, added in the 19th century after the house was moved to Cushing Street.</p>
    <p>Renovations to the house in the 1970s created a studio space and established the gardens, which today include an Acer griseum tree, annuals, herbs, and seedlings.</p>
