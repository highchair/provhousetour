    <p>The Peace and Plenty Garden was established in the 1980s when a diverse coalition of neighbors united in the belief that growing food in urban spaces could make people, and their Southside neighborhood, healthier and happier. The garden is part of the Southside Community Land Trust garden network and utilizes organic and equity-based practices. Food grown at the garden includes produce from gardenersâ€™ home countries, such as Laos, Bhutan, Burma, the Gambia, Liberia, Guatemala, and the Dominican Republic.</p>
    <p>The garden has become a source for hard-to-find produce and is a community anchor that gives back to neighbors experiencing food insecurity. Many youth groups and artists have contributed to the vitality of the garden through an outdoor gallery, murals, sculpture, and a free garden library.</p>
