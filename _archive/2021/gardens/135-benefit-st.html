    <p>Perhaps best known as “The Shunned House” in H.P. Lovecraft’s 1937 short novel of the same name, the John P. Mawney House was constructed nearly 200 years earlier, in 1764. The Georgian-style house is set gable-end to the street, with a south-facing principal entrance and a full-height raised basement. The house’s symmetrical façade, pedimented principal entrance with a glazed transom, and center chimney are typical of its style.</p>
    <p>The terraced, hillside gardens overlooking Benefit Street include a vegetable parterre, a perennial garden with a pergola and grape arbor, and a woodland section with a garden shed.</p>
