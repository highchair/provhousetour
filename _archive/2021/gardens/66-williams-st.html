    <p><em>Entrance at 69 Power Street</em>.</p>
    <p>The Corliss-Carrington House (1810) is a National Historic Landmark. The house was constructed for John Corliss and shortly thereafter purchased by Edward Carrington, a merchant and American diplomat in the early 19th century. The brick house is an excellent example of the Federal style and includes an elliptical fanlight at the principal entrance and a dominant two-story porch that references contemporaneous architecture of Charleston and the American South. The porch includes columns in the Corinthian order on the first floor and the Ionic order on the second floor. Carrington added the third story, the entrance porch, and a small addition to the northeast elevation for his office. </p>
    <p>The houseâ€™s multifaceted landscape is nearly one acre and includes a formal English garden, a cobblestone courtyard, water features, a pergola, and notable trees.</p>
