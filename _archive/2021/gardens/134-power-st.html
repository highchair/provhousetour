    <p>The Edwin Halsey Reynolds House (1852) on Power Street is a classic example of the Greek Revival style. Greek Revival was the dominant building style in the United States from approximately the 1820s to the 1860s, and Providence boasts nationally significant examples of the style, including the Providence Arcade. The three-bay, gable-front, side-hall form of the Reynolds House is prevalent throughout the city.</p>
    <p>The garden, established in 2017, pays homage to 20th century Colonial Revival gardens and includes flowering perennials, a garden folly, stone walls, and blue and white porcelain planters. </p>
