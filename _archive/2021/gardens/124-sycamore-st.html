    <p>The Sycamore Community Garden is an urban agricultural oasis in the cityâ€™s West End neighborhood. Developed on the land of a previous community garden, the present owner has over the past three years reintroduced functional green space to the corner of Sycamore and Chapin Streets. The garden includes a mix of organically grown vegetables, berries, herbs, and flowers tended by seven neighbors and the garden owner, who lives on-site in a new construction home. The garden includes a beehive, water features, and a perimeter fence made from tamarack hewn and milled in Rhode Island. The garden transformed a formerly vacant lot into a happily flourishing community space in the West End.</p>
