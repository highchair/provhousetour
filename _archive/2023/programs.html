      <h2 class="h4">Silver and Steam: Gorham Manufacturing and the Making of Victorian South Elmwood</h2>
      <p><strong>Inaugural Vicki Veh Neighborhood History Lecture by Jim Barnes</strong></p>
      <p>Monday, June 5<br>
        5:30 pm | virtual<br>
        $10 PPS members | $12 general</p>
      <p>The move of the Gorham Manufacturing facility from downtown Providence to a large site on Mashapaug Pond is only one of the many forces that created what we now know as the South Elmwood Historic District. While Gorham is now long gone, its impact remains and provides a great starting point for stories about the houses and people of this extremely diverse and eclectic neighborhood of Providence. James Barnes -- a local architect, RISD professor, and longtime resident of Elmwood -- will explore the 19th-century growth of Providence's first streetcar suburb and provide a backdrop to the Festival house tours taking place on June 10. </p>
