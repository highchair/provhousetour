		    <p class="lead">PPS works to improve Providence by advocating for historic preservation and the enhancement of the city’s unique character through thoughtful design and planning.</p>

		    <h2 class="h4">Advocacy: </h2>
		    <p>PPS works to educate decision-makers on the civic and economic benefits of historic preservation to encourage public policy that facilitates preservation and good design in new development.</p>
		    <ul>
	        <li><strong>Planning and Architectural Review:</strong> Local professionals in the fields of architecture, planning, preservation, and historic rehabilitation comprise a non-regulatory PPS committee that reviews and advises on rehabilitation of historic properties, new construction in historic areas, master plans, and urban design issues.&nbsp; </li>
	        <li><strong><a href="//ppsri.org/advocacy/mep/">Most Endangered Properties List</a>:</strong> Calls public attention to important historic resources threatened by arson, vandalism, deferred maintenance, abandonment and adverse public policy.&nbsp;By working with property owners and other interested parties, and publicizing the buildings through media exposure and more, PPS strives to identify solutions and bring about positive changes that will restore these buildings to productive use while maintaining their historic character. </li>
	        <li><strong><a href="//ppsri.org/advocacy/historic-districts/">Historic Districts</a>:</strong> PPS advises and participates in the application process to identify and officially list those areas of the city identified as eligible for national, state and local historic designation. </li>
	        <li><strong>Neighborhood Assistance:</strong> Committed to citywide action, PPS collaborates with neighborhood groups to identify common issues and establish bases of cooperation, and serves as a conduit and liaison to other organizations and agencies. </li>
		    </ul>
		    <p><em>PPS is a private non-profit organization funded entirely by our members, donors, corporate sponsors, and event-goers.</em></p>

		    <h2 class="h4">Education: </h2>
		    <p>The basis for the protection of historic resources is knowledge and understanding. Therefore, our educational programs seek to create an informed and engaged citizenry. </p>
		    <ul>
	        <li><strong><a href="//ppsri.org/programs-events/markerprogram/">Historic Property Marker Program</a>:</strong> This highly visible symbol recognizes and documents buildings in the city that contribute to our appreciation and understanding of Providence’s unique architectural and historical heritage. </li>
	        <li><strong>Public Programs:</strong> Programs, walks, and lectures teach history and architecture while illuminating the issues around historic preservation and urban design. </li>
	        <li><strong><a href="//ppsri.org/programs-events/historic-preservation-awards/">Preservation Awards</a>:</strong> PPS recognizes individuals and organizations that have made significant contributions to the preservation and betterment of Providence buildings, landscapes and neighborhoods. </li>
	        <li><strong>Providence Symposium:</strong> This high-level program stimulates dialogue around topics relevant to the local preservation movement, and encourages the community to imagine how Providence might develop. </li>
	        <li><strong>Communications:</strong> Our semiannual print newsletter focuses on our most pressing preservation issues. Our monthly e-newsletter and advocacy e-mails inform on timely issues and programs.</li>
