house-name: Henry B. Metcalf House
house-detail: '<i>1855, unknown builder</i><br>Owners: Amanda and Chip Riegel'
house-description: 'An excellent and well-preserved Italianate house, 12 Keene was built in 1855 for Henry B. Metcalf, a merchant in grain and flour. The original address for the house was #8; it was renumbered in 1895. Metcalf and his wife Mary (née Haskell) lived here with their daughter, Abby, their four sons, Robert, William, John, and Charles, and Mary’s two younger sisters, Ann and Ellen Haskell. The younger Haskell sisters were teachers in the public school system. A servant, Mary Boylan of Ireland, lived with the family as well.


The commodious house features hallmarks of the Italianate style. The exterior of wooden clapboards is capped with corner quoins – an effect done in wood to simulate stone blocks, but in this case purely decorative. An intact rounded arch door with glass sidelights and transom dominates the entrance porch.


By 1878, Metcalf sold to Edeth B. H. Mason, wife of Arthur Livingston Mason. The Masons had two children, Edeth and Earl. Two Irish servants, Sarah Jaell and Ellen Carrigan, lived with the family. The house remained in the Mason family until 1917, when it was sold to Emory Porter, a physician.


Changing hands twice after Emory Porter, the house was acquired in 1934 by Charles Alexander Robinson Jr., a Classics professor at Brown University, and his wife, Celia Sachs. Celia was part of the financially powerful Sachs and Goldman families. In 1869, her great-grandfather, Marcus Goldman, founded what would become the famous investment bank Goldman Sachs, bringing on his son-in-law –Celia’s grandfather, Samuel Sachs – in 1882. Charles Robinson was a noted author of several classical history books, many used by him in his teachings at Brown. He would later author several books aimed at introducing children to classical history.


The Robinson family lived at 12 Keene until the mid-1960s. After a subsequent ownership lasting nearly 30 years, its current owners acquired the house in 2017. Since then, the house has undergone minimal changes. The biggest change was a fresh coat of paint and the relocation of the laundry room from the basement to the second floor. The kitchen was renovated in the 1990s following a small fire. Just outside the kitchen is an extension of the living spaces: a round back patio with sweeping stairs down to the wonderful and secluded garden.'
