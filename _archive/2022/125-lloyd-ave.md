house-name: Lindsay T. Damon House
house-detail: '<i>1904, Norman M. Isham architect</i><br>Owners: Ruth and Mark Guyer'
house-description: 'Famed historian, architect, and preservationist Norman Isham designed this serene adaptation of a Tudor Revival in 1904. Isham, a native of Hartford, Connecticut, attended schools in Providence. He received his undergraduate degree and Master’s in art from Brown University, finishing in 1890. While still a student, Isham began working for the Providence architectural firm of Stone, Carpenter & Willson in 1886. He later worked as head draftsman for the firm of Martin & Hall in 1894. He co-wrote a book with Albert Brown titled Early Rhode Island Houses, published in 1895, marking Isham’s first movement at studying 17th-century colonial architecture. Isham would go on to fully document and analyze the state’s earliest structures. He became the leading expert on the subject, most notably, stone-ender houses.  


Isham’s design for Brown professor of English Lindsay Damon is a perfect blend of the ideals of the architect and his client. With the entrance situated to the side, one approaches the door underneath a semi-circular bracketed hood. There are slight overhangs on each floor, tracing back to the early colonial garrisons that typically included a drop pendant of an acorn or pineapple beneath the overhang.  


Damon’s residency at 125 Lloyd was not long, for he sold the property in 1908 to fellow Brown professor Camillo Von Klenze. By 1916, the house was transferred to Elizabeth O’Keefe. O’Keefe’s husband, Walter, was a physician. Three years later, the house was purchased by Henry Boss, a lawyer, whose office was located at 15 Westminster Street. The house would remain in the Boss family until 1951. After several subsequent owners, the house was purchased by the current owners in 2018.  


The owners were drawn to the home’s original latticed windows. On the front façade is a small medallion with a griffin; a fire-insurance mark used by firefighting companies to identify the houses of their paid subscribers. In the rear of the house is the living room with a central fireplace flanked by bookcases, imitating the inglenook designs of the period. The kitchen was remodeled by the previous owners about a decade ago.  


Of particular interest are the works of art throughout the home. The owner’s father was artist Irving Guyer (1916-2012). Guyer was trained at the Art Students League in New York City, after which he was employed by the Federal Art Project of the WPA for two years. His painting “Mosholu Parkway” won a prize at the New York World’s Fair in 1939. He served in the Army during World War II and then worked as a commercial artist in New York. His artistic output increased through the 1960s, during which he had three gallery shows in New York City. In 1977, while attending an art show at the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC, Guyer saw a major retrospective of Matisse cutouts and was inspired to do a series of semi-abstract California landscapes in the style of the cutouts. He continued painting until his death in 2012, working in a number of styles but mostly with a landscape/nature focus. Guyer’s works are held by the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and many other collections. '
