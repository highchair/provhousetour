          <h2 class="h3">Eight Featured Gardens</h2>
          <p>Located in four city neighborhoods from the East Side to Elmwood, the eight featured gardens will exhibit a variety of plantings and contemporary interpretations of historic garden design. Six of the featured properties are private residential gardens located at historic houses. Green-thumbed homeowners have transformed their city backyards into urban sanctuaries by using water features, pergolas, and courtyards to accent rhododendrons, mossy vignettes, and old and notable trees. Not just beautiful, many of the gardens are also functional — vegetable beds, fruit trees, herbs, a hops trellis, and beehives await tour attendees. Guests are also invited to tour a community garden established in the 1980s and farmed by local families and neighborhood organizations using organic practices, as well as the Colonial Revival garden at Shakespeare’s Head, one of PPS’s historic properties on Meeting Street.</p>

          <h2 class="h3">About the Festival</h2>
          <p>Explore homes on Keene Street and Lloyd Avenue, part of the tree-lined neighborhoods north of Brown University between Angell and Olney Streets. This area represents a period of economic growth and diversification of architectural styles in Providence’s history. The earliest houses appeared closest to Prospect in the 1850s, and by the 1870s, ample Second Empire and Italianate houses dotted the neighborhood. The building boom of the 1880s and 1890s saw a blend of Queen Anne and Colonial Revival houses, all comfortable in size, rich in detail, and set back from the streets to allow for a dense landscape of flora. The residents were professionals; business and tradesmen who worked downtown, or perhaps in management at one of Providence’s numerous factories. The proximity to Brown University and Rhode Island School of Design also attracted professors to this burgeoning enclave. </p>
          <p>Today, the neighborhood is known for its impressive array of carefully maintained and preserved houses. The streets are tree-lined and the parcels are handsomely landscaped, creating an oasis within the urban fabric. Residents who live in this historic district take pride in their neighborhood and have made their homes functional for the 21st century. </p>
