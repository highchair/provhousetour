      <p class="lead">This year, Providence Preservation Society’s Festival’s Festival of Historic Houses goes <b>MODERN</b> — and stretches to <a href="{% link schedule.html %}">an entire week of programs</a> that explore modernism in Providence in the period 1950 to 1990.</p>

      <p>Join us on <b>Sunday, October 5</b> for the opening of the Festival of Modern Design with <a href="{% link program/pratt-st-walking-tour.html %}">a morning walking tour of the modern, postmodern and contemporary architecture of Pratt Street</a>.</p>

      <p>That evening, the Festival’s keynote address will be given by the design historian and curator Donald Albrecht. Albrecht’s presentation, “<a href="{% link program/designing-home.html %}">Designing Home: Jews and Midcentury Modernism</a>” will address the role Jewish designers, architects, and patrons played in shaping modernism in America.</p>

      <p>Throughout the week, enjoy lectures, walks, panel conversations, and behind-the-scenes tours of modern furniture and decorative arts collections. Special events include the <a href="{% link program/mid-mod-cocktail-party.html %}">Mid Mod Cocktail Party</a> on Thursday, October 9 at a 1959 Castellucci Galli home on the East Side; a symposium on Friday, October 10 titled <a href="{% link program/providence-modern.html %}">Providence Modern (1945-1995): Architecture, Design, Planning, Culture</a>; and our signature open house event on <b>Saturday, October 11</b>, which includes <a href="{% link program/open-house-tour.html %}">access to a dozen homes on the East Side</a> designed by architects including Ira Rakatansky and Friedrich St Florian.</p>

      <p>The Festival of Modern Design participates in <a href="https://docomomo-us.org/events/tour-day">Docomomo’s Tour Day</a> on October 11, joining this nation-wide celebration of modernism with programs organized by architecture and preservation groups across the country.</p>
