          <p>Explore homes on Keene Street and Lloyd Avenue, part of the tree-lined neighborhoods north of Brown University between Angell and Olney Streets. This area represents a period of economic growth and diversification of architectural styles in Providence’s history. The earliest houses appeared closest to Prospect in the 1850s, and by the 1870s, ample Second Empire and Italianate houses dotted the neighborhood. The building boom of the 1880s and 1890s saw a blend of Queen Anne and Colonial Revival houses, all comfortable in size, rich in detail, and set back from the streets to allow for a dense landscape of flora. The residents were professionals; business and tradesmen who worked downtown, or perhaps in management at one of Providence’s numerous factories. The proximity to Brown University and Rhode Island School of Design also attracted professors to this burgeoning enclave. </p>
          <p>Today, the neighborhood is known for its impressive array of carefully maintained and preserved houses. The streets are tree-lined and the parcels are handsomely landscaped, creating an oasis within the urban fabric. Residents who live in this historic district take pride in their neighborhood and have made their homes functional for the 21st century. </p>
