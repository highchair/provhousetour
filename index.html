          <p>With twenty-five official neighborhoods and countless historic homes, cultural landscapes, and private gardens, Providence is bursting with places to explore. Since 1980, the <a href="//ppsri.org" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">Providence Preservation Society</a> (<span class="abbr">PPS</span>) has produced the Festival of Historic Houses as a way to get to know the streets and homes that you won’t necessarily find in any guidebook. Each year, the Festival highlights the architecture and history of one of Providence’s historic neighborhoods, drawing hundreds of people from near and far.</p>
          <p>On <b>Saturday, June 4</b>, <span class="abbr">PPS</span> will present the 40th Festival of Historic Houses. This year, the self-guided tour will explore homes and gardens on Keene Street and Lloyd Avenue, an intimate part of the tree-lined neighborhoods north of Brown University between Angell and Olney Streets. Special guided tours of private gardens will also take place on Sunday, June 5, in partnership with <a href="//www.gardenconservancy.org" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">the Garden Conservancy</a>.</p>
          <p>In addition to <a href="{% link tours.html %}">the weekend’s tours</a> of this historic neighborhood, an exclusive <a href="{% link preview.html %}">Preview Party</a>, and a diverse slate of <a href="{% link programs.html %}">virtual pre-Festival programming</a> will be offered. We hope you will join us!</p>
