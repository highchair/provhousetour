          <p>On Saturday, June 4, the <b>Providence Preservation Society</b> will present the 40th Festival of Historic Houses. This year, the self-guided tour will explore homes and gardens along the crest of College Hill on Keene Street and Lloyd Avenue (originally slated for 2020). Special guided tours of private gardens will also take place on Sunday, June 5, in partnership with <a href="//www.gardenconservancy.org" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">the Garden Conservancy</a>.</p>

          <p>Keene Street and Lloyd Avenue are an intimate part of the tree-lined neighborhoods north of
          Brown University between Angell and Olney Streets. The earliest houses in this area appeared in
          the 1850s and by the 1870s, ample Second Empire and Italianate style houses dotted the
          neighborhood. The building boom of the 1880s and 1890s saw a blend of Queen Anne and
          Colonial Revival houses, all comfortable in size, rich in detail, and set back from the streets to
          allow for a dense landscape of flora. The proximity to Brown University and Rhode Island
          School of Design also attracted professors to this burgeoning enclave, while the nearby Thayer
          Street commercial district provided household needs and entertainment.</p>

          <h2 class="h3">Eight Featured Gardens</h2>
          <p>Located in four city neighborhoods from the East Side to Elmwood, the eight featured gardens will exhibit a variety of plantings and contemporary interpretations of historic garden design. Six of the featured properties are private residential gardens located at historic houses. Green-thumbed homeowners have transformed their city backyards into urban sanctuaries by using water features, pergolas, and courtyards to accent rhododendrons, mossy vignettes, and old and notable trees. Not just beautiful, many of the gardens are also functional — vegetable beds, fruit trees, herbs, a hops trellis, and beehives await tour attendees. Guests are also invited to tour a community garden established in the 1980s and farmed by local families and neighborhood organizations using organic practices, as well as the Colonial Revival garden at Shakespeare’s Head, one of PPS’s historic properties on Meeting Street.</p>
