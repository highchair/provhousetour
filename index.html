          <h2 class="h3">Eight Featured Gardens</h2>
          <p>Located in four city neighborhoods from the East Side to Elmwood, the eight featured gardens will exhibit a variety of plantings and contemporary interpretations of historic garden design. Six of the featured properties are private residential gardens located at historic houses. Green-thumbed homeowners have transformed their city backyards into urban sanctuaries by using water features, pergolas, and courtyards to accent rhododendrons, mossy vignettes, and old and notable trees. Not just beautiful, many of the gardens are also functional — vegetable beds, fruit trees, herbs, a hops trellis, and beehives await tour attendees. Guests are also invited to tour a community garden established in the 1980s and farmed by local families and neighborhood organizations using organic practices, as well as the Colonial Revival garden at Shakespeare’s Head, one of PPS’s historic properties on Meeting Street.</p>
