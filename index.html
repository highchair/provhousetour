      <p>For more than 40 years, the <a href="//ppsri.org/">Providence Preservation Society</a> (<span class="abbr">PPS</span>) has produced the <b>Festival of Historic Houses</b> as a way to get to know the streets and homes that you won’t necessarily find in any guidebook. Each year, the Festival highlights the architecture and history of one of Providence’s historic neighborhoods, drawing hundreds of people from near and far.</p>
      <p>On <strong>Saturday, June 8,</strong> <span class="abbr">PPS</span> will present the 42nd Festival of Historic Houses. This year, the self-guided tour will explore homes and gardens in the historic Mount Hope neighborhood, including Larch Street, Ivy Street, Forest Street, and Catalpa Road.</p>
      <p>In addition to <a href="{% link tour.html %}">Saturday’s tours of this historic neighborhood</a>, an exclusive <a href="{% link preview.html %}">Kickoff Party</a> and several <a href="{% link programs.html %}">Festival walks and talks</a> will be offered. We hope you will join us!</p>
