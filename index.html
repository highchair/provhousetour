Since 1980, the <a href="//www.ppsri.org" target="_blank" title="Opens a new window">Providence Preservation Society</a> (<span class-"abbr">PPS</span>) has produced the Festival of Historic Houses as a way to get to know the streets and homes that you won’t necessarily find in any guidebook. Each year, the Festival highlights the architecture and history of one of Providence’s historic neighborhoods, drawing hundreds of people from near and far.</p>
      <p>On <strong>Saturday, June 10</strong>, <span class-"abbr">PPS</span> will present the 41st Festival of Historic Houses. This year, the self-guided tour will explore homes and gardens in the historic Elmwood neighborhood, between Congress and Adelaide Avenues.</p>
      <p>In addition to <a href="{% link tour.html %}">Saturday’s tours</a> of this historic neighborhood, an exclusive <a href="{% link preview.html %}">Preview Party</a> and a diverse slate of <a href="{% link programs.html %}">virtual and in-person pre-Festival programming</a> will be offered. <strong>We hope you will join us!</strong></p>
