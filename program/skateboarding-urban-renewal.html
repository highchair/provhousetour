      <h2 class="h4">What Grows from Urban Renewal? Skateboarding Meets Local 3 at Cathedral Square | Walking Tour + Skateboarding Demonstration</h2>

      <p>Through the mid 1970’s the Bricklayers and Allied Trades Local 3 trade union built the paved landscape descending from David Gavitt Way to the entrance of Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral, continuing down the footprint of Westminster Street across Greene Street and ending at Empire Street. This guided walking tour, led by Will Cornwall, will explore the cultural influence of this brick, concrete, stone and steel landscape on the local skateboarding subculture. There will be five stops at architectural features in the Cathedral Square space.  At each stop tour attendees will have smart phone access to a brief archival film showing the skateboarding history specific to that respective architectural feature. The tour will conclude with a skateboarding demonstration at the Trinity Skatespot on Adrian Hall Way.</p>
