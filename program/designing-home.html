      <p>This presentation explores the now-ubiquitous midcentury-modern style in order to consider it anew, through the lens of Jewish American adaptation and assimilation. It highlights the contributions of well-known figures such as Anni Albers and Richard Neutra alongside those of lesser-known or critically overlooked artists, including Ruth Adler Schnee and Marguerite Wildenhain. <i>Designing Home</i> also identifies the significant Jewish patrons, critics, and merchants who helped midcentury-modern design reach a popular audience. Underscoring the fact that these figures were not working in isolation, <i>Designing Home</i> focuses on six hubs across the United States that were critical in the broad dissemination of modernist design principles between the 1930s and the 1950s: the Museum of Modern Art, New York; Black Mountain College, Black Mountain, North Carolina; the Institute of Design at the Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago; the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; Arts and Architecture magazine, Los Angeles; and Pond Farm, Guerneville, California.</p>
