      <h2 class="h4">Providence Modern Open House</h2>
      <p>Going since 1958, this is PPS’s 43rd open house event — but the very first to focus on modernism! Step inside a dozen of Providence’s most significant modern and contemporary homes in the Wayland, Blackstone, and College Hill neighborhoods built between 1950 and 2016. Many of the homes include period built-ins and spectacular collections of modern furniture and art. Learn about the vanguard patrons who commissioned these homes, how they have evolved over the decades, and about the unique challenges that come with preserving and maintaining modern and contemporary architecture.</p>
      <p>The homes are clustered in two locations on the East Side and a walking/biking map will be given to all registrants at event check-in. The registration site is School One, 220 University Avenue, renovated by KITE Architects. PPS’s office at 24 Meeting Street will also be open for the duration of the day and can be used as restroom or break stop close to the College Hill homes that are participating.</p>
      <p>Loop 1 in the Wayland/Blackstone neighborhood includes seven homes in a 1.7-mile loop. Loop 2 in the College Hill neighborhood includes four homes in a 1.3-mile loop. Ambitious urban hikers can complete both loops on foot, departing from and arriving back at the School One registration site for a total of 4.5 miles. Biking is also a terrific way to participate in this event!</p>

      <p>Please note that the annual RISD Craft Fair takes place from 10am to 4pm — consider making a day of it, hitting the Providence Modern Open House on the early side and ending the day at the Craft Fair! The Fair begins four blocks from the last house in Loop 2, and only two blocks from PPS’s office, which will be open until 4pm as a restroom or break stop.</p>  

      <p>Saturday, October 11 | 10am–4pm</p>
      <p><b>Tickets: $25 Students / $65 PPS and Docomomo Members / $75 General</b></p>

      <p>The Providence Modern Open House benefits PPS’s year-round efforts to document, interpret, preserve and advocate for Providence’s architectural landmarks and beloved places. This event is not to be missed!</p>
