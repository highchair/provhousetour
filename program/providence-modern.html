      <h3 class="h4">8:30 – 10:25am | The Modern City | 1950 – 1970</h3>

      <h4 class="h5">Building Modernist Here: Ira Rakatansky's Small Homes of the 40s and 50s</h4>
      <p>Son of an immigrant Russian contractor and nephew of a skilled seamstress, Ira Rakatansky arrived at Harvard’s GSD with deep understanding of how things were made. Through his studies with Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer, for whom he worked as a first American employee, Rakatansky developed a strong spatial sensibility for the openness of Modern architecture. Working for himself in Providence after graduation, he combined his smarts with a vision of contemporary life to realize a series of unorthodox and beautiful small houses.</p>

      <p><img class="img-fluid img__right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}assets/img/speakers/widder.jpg" alt="" /><b>Lynnette Widder</b> is Professor of Practice at Columbia University and author of three books on architecture. Her architectural design work with aardvarchitecture and on her own has been widely published. Her recent articles appear in <i>New German Critique</i> and <i>Oxonian Review, Urban Omnibus, Dimensions</i> and <i>Materia</i>.</p>

      <h4 class="h5" style="clear: both;">Project Turnkey: Exploring the Complex History Behind Providence’s First-in-the-Nation Automated Post Office (1959-60)</h4>
      <p>Built as the first automated post office in 1959-1960 and designed by C. A. Maguire, the Providence Post Office was constructed through a novel leaseback agreement between the Postal Department and I.T.T., the private company that owned and constructed the facility. It served not only as a technological testament to the future and political chess piece in the 1960 election, but also as the center piece of the urban renewal project known as the West River Industrial Park.

      <p><img class="img-fluid img__right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}assets/img/speakers/maddock-thomas.jpg" alt="" /><b>Maddock Thomas</b> is a senior in the urban studies program at Brown University with an interest in the relationship between design and the evolution of the 20th century urban landscape. He has published extensively on railroads and public transit from both a historical and policy perspective and serves as the President of the Brown Labor Council. His honors thesis focuses on the Providence Post Office where labor, politics, design, and transportation themes collide.</p>

      <h4 class="h5" style="clear: both;">Ira Rakatansky: In Plain Sight?</h4>
      <p>In William Jordy’s Buildings of Rhode Island (2004) the sole citation of Ira Rakatansky was by name only, merely listing his addition to the Brown Faculty Club. Twenty years later—subsequent to the 2010 publication of John Caserta and Lynnette Widder’s Ira Rakatansky: As Modern as Tomorrow, the acquisition of his archive by his alma mater Harvard University, tours of his work by DOCOMOMO and the SAH—he has been cited in Katy Picken’s PPS Cityscape article “Providence Modern: The Work of Ira Rakatansky” as “arguably Providence’s preeminent modernist.” And yet, seemingly now no longer hidden in plain sight, the innovations of his Rhode Island modernism may still have more to reveal beyond their seemingly plain-sighted clean modernist lines, which should, as Dorothy Agnew’s 1957 Providence Sunday Journal’s feature article’s title foretold, make us “look twice.”</p>

      <p><img class="img-fluid img__right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}assets/img/speakers/mark-rakatansky.jpg" alt="" /><b>Mark Rakatansky</b> is an Adjunct Associate Professor in the Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation at Columbia University, and principal of Mark Rakatansky Studio. He is the author of Tectonic Acts of Desire and Doubt (2012) and the forthcoming <i>Signifying Media: The Imprinting of Palladio</i> (2026). Grants and Fellowships include the Chicago Institute for Architecture and Urbanism, the Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts, Elise Jaffe + Jeffrey Brown, The New York State Council on the Arts, and the Samuel H. Kress Fellowship from The James Marston Fitch Foundation.</p>

      <h4 class="h5" style="clear: both;">High Modernism for High Waters: The Fox Point Hurricane Barrier and the “Providence Renaissance”</h4>
      <p>Completed in 1966, the Fox Point Hurricane Barrier (FPHB) is seldom mentioned in accounts of downtown Providence’s waterfront revival. And yet, without a giant dam to keep it dry, the inner harbor of the Providence River would almost certainly not have become the locus of placemaking and public investment that it has been for the last forty years. This presentation will explore the making of the FPHB, its complex legacy, and the inner harbor’s possible futures.</p>
      
      <p><img class="img-fluid img__right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}assets/img/speakers/samia-cohen.jpg" alt="" /><b>Samia Cohen</b> (she or they) is a writer, editor, teacher, public scholar, and creative practitioner with an interest in environmental storytelling, urban environmental history, and transgender studies. She is at work on a book manuscript, titled <i>Impermeable: Stories of A Landfilled Urban Coast</i>, that explores the hydrological legacy of Providence, Rhode Island, where Samia was born, and the life that free-flowing water has supported in the city across time.</p>
      
      <h4 class="h5" style="clear: both;">Bill Warner and Providence’s Architecture Culture in the 1960s and 1970s</h4>
      <p>Wampler was a young RISD student when he went to work for Bill Warner in the early 1960s. In this conversation, Wampler recalls his time working in Warner’s office during this period and what architecture and planning culture was like in the city well before its “Renaissance.”</p>
      
      <p><b>Jan Wampler</b> received his Bachelor of Science in Architecture at the Rhode Island School of Design in 1963 and his Master of Architecture in Urban Design from the Harvard Graduate School of Design in 1964. He was a Professor of Architecture at the MIT School of Architecture and has been a Visiting Professor at several universities around the world, including the University of California at Berkeley, the University of Sydney in Australia,and Tsinghua University in Beijing, China. Wampler is a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects and was awarded the Distinguished Professor honor from the Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture.

      <h4 class="h5" style="clear: both;">Displaced by Design: Mid-Century Public Housing in Providence</h4>
      <p>This presentation explores how Providence's public housing developments were architectural expressions of modernist ideology and instruments of racial segregation. As urban renewal cleared entire neighborhoods throughout the city in the mid-20th century, where did these displaced residents go? We follow a handful of families from redevelopment areas, looking to understand the systematic relocation of non-white, lower-income families to public housing. Through case studies of specific Providence housing developments and the communities they replaced, this talk examines how public housing policy combined with modernist planning and design transformed the city’s landscape.</p>

      <p><img class="img-fluid img__right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}assets/img/speakers/keating-zelenke.jpg" alt="" /><b>Keating Zelenke</b> is a reporter-researcher for The Providence Post, a newsletter from the Providence Preservation Society. Before moving to Rhode Island, she received national recognition as a two-time finalist for the Hearst Journalism Awards. As the daughter of a carpenter, she has an interest in understanding the places we call home.</p>
      
      <h4 class="h5" style="clear: both;">The Removal of the Negro: Urban Renewal in Providence, Rhode Island</h4>
      <p>In the post-WWII era, Providence, RI became home to rich African Diasporic communities. Merchant marine and the whaling Cape Verdean communities made their homes in Fox Point. Laborers, agricultural workers, and entrepreneurs from the southern United States as well as West African and Afro-Caribbean migrants that clustered around Prairie Avenue and Lippitt Hill. Federal, state, and city policy flattened these communities into the bulk shorthand “Negro,” at the same time as these populations continued to expand in the 1970s. Urban renewal policies had a sweeping effect on the availability of public and private housing to Black communities, resulting in multigenerational loss of individual real property and in aggregate community power. This presentation weaves and disaggregates the term “Negro” by utilizing cartography and objects to narrate stories of community loss in the urban landscape.</p>
      
      <p><img class="img-fluid img__right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}assets/img/speakers/christopher-west.jpg" alt="" /><b>Christopher West</b> is the Executive Director of the African American Museum of Rhode Island, a community-based initiative that preserves history of the African Diaspora in the 20th and 21st centuries with a focus on workforce development. AAMRI uniquely creates a space for youth to research, preserve and tell Black stories.</p>
      
      <h4 class="h5" style="clear: both;">Model Cities in Providence: Planning Participation at the Fall of Urban Renewal</h4>
      <p>When the Model Cities Program arrived in 150 cities in the late 1960s, it wagered that federal funding for participatory planning and social programs could accomplish what physical  development alone had not: improving the lives of low-income and racially marginalized communities. Analyzing the work of Model Cities in Providence reveals the program’s promises and pitfalls, offering important lessons for the pursuit of more just cities.</p>  
      
      <p><b>Jeremy Lee Wolin</b> is a PhD candidate in History and Theory of Architecture at Princeton University who studies the impact of race, design, and the state on architectures of social welfare. His current project tracks how struggles over the construction of spaces for health, education, employment, and social services articulated the terms of minority citizenship in the post-civil rights era. His work has appeared in <i>Planning Perspectives</i>, the <i>Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians</i>, the <i>Journal of Asian American Studies</i>, and <i>Metropole</i>. Previously, he taught at Pratt Institute and received a BA from Brown University and a BFA from Rhode Island School of Design.</p>
      
      <h4 class="h5" style="clear: both;">Blue Collar Rhody: Transforming “Infill” into “Historical Fabric”</h4>
      <p>Claire and Michael will talk about the vanguard work of the Tockwotton Fox Point Cape Verdean Project team, and how “they leverage 21st-century digital technology to preserve, maintain, and create a digital footprint of the living but physically erased history of Rhode Island’s first Cape Verdean neighborhood.” (2022 Most Endangered Property, Providence Preservation Society), <a href="//www.downthepoint.com">www.downthepoint.com</a>.</p>

      <h3 class="h4">1:15 – 2:50pm: Architecture on the Edge | 1970 – Present</h3>
      
      <h4 class="h5" style="clear: both;">The Last Supper of Architecture: Providence c. 1972</h4>
      <p>This talk explores a series of global currents in architecture culture that converged in Providence's design scene in the early 1970s, particularly around RISD and Brown. This story focuses on the important but little-known Architecture 1962-1972 exhibition at the newly-opened List Arts Center at Brown, which featured the work of four international avant garde architects who all taught at RISD in these years: Adolfo Natalini of Superstudio, Michael Webb of Archigram, Friedrich St. Florian, and Michael Webb.</p>
      
      <p><img class="img-fluid img__right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}assets/img/speakers/kubo.jpg" alt="" /><b>Michael Kubo</b> is an associate professor in the department of architecture at the Rhode Island School of Design. His practice spans the fields of architectural history and theory, advocacy and historic preservation, and curatorial and publishing practices.

      <h4 class="h5" style="clear: both;">Misunderstood Modernism, the Design Concepts underlying 110 Congdon Street (1974)</h4>
      <p>The Dr. William Mauran House, often characterized as brutalist, and appears to contrast to its neighborhood context. In this session, we will learn, in an interesting twist, that the real drivers of the design were the site and context, along with the owner’s desire for a modern residence.</p>

      <h4 class="h5" style="clear: both;">Friedrich St. Florian - Contextual Modernist</h4>
      <p>Friedrich St. Florian (1932-2024) is best known for his design of the World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C. (2004), but his architectural oeuvre over six decades was far ranging and stylistically varied - from laser installations and ephemeral, visionary projects in the 1960s and 1970s to contextual houses on Providence's East Side and the design of the Providence Place Mall. His ideas were instrumental in the redevelopment of Providence's urban core, and during his many years as Dean of Architecture at RISD, he made the school and our city a center of debates about contemporary architecture.
