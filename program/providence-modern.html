      <h2 class="h4">Presentations</h2>
      <h3>Lynnette Widder</h3>
      <p>Son of an immigrant Russian contractor and nephew of a skilled seamstress, Ira Rakatansky arrived at Harvard's GSD with deep understanding of how things were made. Through his studies with Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer, for whom he worked as a first American employee, Rakatansky developed a strong spatial sensibility for the openness of Modern architecture. Working for himself in Providence after graduation, he combined his smarts with a vision of contemporary life to realize a series of unorthodox and beautiful small houses.</p>

      <h3>Maddock Thomas</h3>
      <p>Built as the first automated post office in 1959-1960 and designed by C. A. Maguire, the Providence Post Office was constructed through a novel leaseback agreement between the Postal Department and I.T.T., the private company that owned and constructed the facility. It served not only as a technological testament to the future and political chess piece in the 1960 election, but also as the center piece of the urban renewal project known as the West River Industrial Park.</p>

      <h3>Mark Rakatansky</h3>
      <p>In William Jordy’s Buildings of Rhode Island (2004) the sole citation of Ira Rakatansky was by name only, merely listing his addition to the Brown Faculty Club. Twenty years later—subsequent to the 2010 publication of John Caserta and Lynnette Widder’s Ira Rakatansky: As Modern as Tomorrow, the acquisition of his archive by his alma mater Harvard University, tours of his work by DOCOMOMO and the SAH—he has been cited in Katy Picken’s PPS Cityscape article “Providence Modern: The Work of Ira Rakatansky” as “arguably Providence’s preeminent modernist.” And yet, seemingly now no longer hidden in plain sight, the innovations of his Rhode Island modernism may still have more to reveal beyond their seemingly plain-sighted clean modernist lines, which should, as Dorothy Agnew’s 1957 Providence Sunday Journal’s feature article’s title foretold, make us “look twice.”</p>

      <h3>Samia Cohen</h3>
      <p>Completed in 1966, the Fox Point Hurricane Barrier (FPHB) is seldom mentioned in accounts of downtown Providence’s waterfront revival. And yet, without a giant dam to keep it dry, the inner harbor of the Providence River would almost certainly not have become the locus of placemaking and public investment that it has been for the last forty years. This presentation will explore the making of the FPHB, its complex legacy, and the inner harbor’s possible futures.</p>

      <h3>Marisa Brown and Jan Wampler</h3>
      <p>Wampler was a young RISD student when he went to work for Bill Warner in the early 1960s. In this conversation, Wampler recalls his time working in Warner’s office during this period and what architecture and planning culture was like in the city well before its “Renaissance.”</p>

      <h3>Katy, Keating and B.L Jordan</h3>
      <p>This presentation explores how Providence's public housing developments were architectural expressions of modernist ideology and instruments of racial segregation. As urban renewal cleared entire neighborhoods throughout the city in the mid-20th century, where did these displaced residents go? We follow a handful of families from redevelopment areas, looking to understand the systematic relocation of non-white, lower-income families to public housing. Through case studies of specific Providence housing developments and the communities they replaced, this talk examines how public housing policy combined with modernist planning and design transformed the city's landscape.</p>

      <h3>Christopher West</h3>
      <p>In the post-WWII era, Providence, RI became home to rich African Diasporic communities. Merchant marine and the whaling Cape Verdean communities made their homes in Fox Point. Laborers, agricultural workers, and entrepreneurs from the southern United States as well as West African and Afro-Caribbean migrants that clustered around Prairie Avenue and Lippitt Hill. Federal, state, and city policy flattened these communities into the bulk shorthand "Negro," at the same time as these populations continued to expand in the 1970s. Urban renewal policies had a sweeping effect on the availability of public and private housing to Black communities, resulting in multigenerational loss of individual real property and in aggregate community power. This presentation weaves and disaggregates the term "Negro" by utilizing cartography and objects to narrate stories of community loss in the urban landscape.</p>

      <h3>Edwige and funmi</h3>
      <p>The South Providence People’s Archive (SPPA) is an emerging collection commemorating the Black and Native American legacies and lineages of South Providence (RI) – past and present. The archive’s co-founders, Edwige Charlot and k. funmilayo aileru, will present their relationship-based process of bringing intimate accounts of Black and Native American life to the public record.</p>

      <h3>Claire Andrade-Watkins and Michael Pereira</h3>
      <p>Claire and Michael will talk about the vanguard work of the Tockwotton Fox Point Cape Verdean Project team, and how “they leverage 21st-century digital technology to preserve, maintain, and create a digital footprint of the living but physically erased history of Rhode Island’s first Cape Verdean neighborhood.” (2022 Most Endangered Property, Providence Preservation Society), <a href="https://www.downthepoint.com">downthepoint.com</a>.</p>

      <h3>Michael Kubo</h3>
      <p>This talk explores a series of global currents in architecture culture that converged in Providence's design scene in the early 1970s, particularly around RISD and Brown. This story focuses on the important but little-known Architecture 1962-1972 exhibition at the newly-opened List Arts Center at Brown, which featured the work of four international avant garde architects who all taught at RISD in these years: Adolfo Natalini of Superstudio, Michael Webb of Archigram, Friedrich St. Florian, and Michael Webb.</p>

      <h3>Ed Hodges</h3>
      <p>The Dr. William Mauran House, often characterized as brutalist, and appears to contrast to its neighborhood context. In this session, we will learn, in an interesting twist, that the real drivers of the design were the site and context, along with the owner’s desire for a modern residence.</p>

      <h3>Christine West</h3>
      <p>Using the recently completed Summer Street Apartments, KITE Principal Christine West, AIA will describe how KITE Architects’ design approach  is neither “traditional” nor “modern”. It offers a new path forward that centers our needs as humans blended with a rigorous approach to craft.  This viewpoint is central to understanding the unique urban character of the largest supportive housing complex in New England.</p>
