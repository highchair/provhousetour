      <p>Pratt Street has been referred to as the architect Friedrich St Florian’s design lab, a sandbox for modernists, and Providence’s seat of modern luxury living. The homes on Pratt Street span 1800 to 2004, but nearly half of them were designed after 1950. Join us for a walking conversation about how Pratt Street came to be Providence’s most modern street. Tour leaders include two architects who worked in St Florian’s studio – Nick de Pace and Stephen Rogers — and Jason Martin, Preservation Planner for the City of Providence.</p>
