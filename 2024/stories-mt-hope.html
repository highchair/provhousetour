  <h2 class="h4">Joseph Henry Ball family</h2>
  <p>
    LOCATION: 96 Grand View Street<br>
    TIME PERIOD: c. 1860–1890
  </p>

  <p>Joseph Henry Ball was born into slavery in Virginia around 1825. He declared his own freedom in 1857 and successfully fought to free his family, who ultimately settled in the Mount Hope neighborhood in 1873.</p>
  
  <p>Fearing their enslavers might sell him or his wife and children to a family member, Ball fled North from Virginia and sheltered in Toronto, Canada while working with Black abolitionist and Underground Railroad conductor William Still to reunite the family. Ball’s wife, Mary, and their five children — Ann, Elizabeth, Mary, Leah, and Oscar — eventually joined Ball in Canada (a sixth child, Jenette, was born in Toronto) before moving to Transit Street in Providence by 1865.</p>
  
  <p>The Balls’ young children attended the Meeting Street School (now the headquarters of Providence Preservation Society), which remained a public school dedicated to children of color even after Providence schools desegregated in the 1860s. In 1873, Joseph purchased property and built a home on Grand View Street, which still stands today. The Ball family lived here for many years; Joseph worked as a laborer, sexton, and janitor and was active in the Grand United Order of Odd Fellows and the Masons. After Mary died in 1887, Joseph married Delilah Waters, and she joined him in his home until his death in 1892.</p>

  <h2 class="h4">Rhode Island School for the Deaf</h2>
  <p>
    LOCATION: Hope Street, corner of Cypress Street<br>
    TIME PERIOD: c. 1870s–1940s 
  </p>

  <p><img class="img-fluid" src="{% link assets/guidebook/RI-School-Deaf-img-2.jpg %}" alt="" /></p>

  <p>Like many private schools of its time, the Rhode Island School for the Deaf began in a converted single-family home, opening in 1876 on Hope and Cypress Streets through the work and patronage of Mary Balch Lippitt. As the wife of Governor Henry Lippitt, Mary had access to the resources needed to build a new school for Deaf and Hard of Hearing children, inspired by her daughter, Jeannie.</p>
  
  <p>The Rhode Island School for the Deaf practiced two main philosophies in its early days. First, students were taught to communicate via “oral speaking,” (reliance on lip-reading is now critiqued by many in the Deaf community), and second, students were given skills to pursue a trade or craft after graduation. Lip reading and voice training were reinforced in all classes, which included music, geography, history, cooking, and sloyd (a Scandinavian method of craft-based education).</p>
  
  <p>Many of the students and teachers boarded onsite, and the school was long staffed and managed primarily by women. Archival materials tell a story of a diverse group of teachers and administrators who came from all over the country, living and working together in support of their students. The Rhode Island School for the Deaf still serves Deaf and Hard of Hearing students from all over the state, but has moved from the Hope Street location to Corliss Park.</p>

  <h2 class="h4">Ah Jin Lee </h2>
  <p>
    LOCATION: Camp Street <br>
    TIME PERIOD: 1920s–40s  
  </p>
  
  <p><img class="img-fluid" src="{% link assets/guidebook/AJ-Lee-img.jpg %}" alt="" /></p>
  
  <p>Born in San Francisco around 1884, Ah Jin Lee (variously referred to as Ah Jin, Ah Jim and Jim Lee) was born just a few years after the Chinese Exclusion Act passed, amidst growing anti-Chinese sentiment and violence. In adulthood, Lee made his way across the country and soon made his home here in Providence. Evidence suggests Lee was a successful businessman: he opened a laundry on Camp Street, and by 1926 newspapers referred to Lee as “wealthy” and noted that he also owned a grocery store in Boston and a restaurant on Mott Street in New York City.</p>
  
  <p>Around 1900, only 200 people of Chinese descent lived in Rhode Island, and the ratio strongly favored men over women. Lee was introduced to Oi Gem Quong, the daughter of a fellow laundry proprietor in Lowell, and the couple posted their intent to marry in the local newspaper. A policewoman raised the objection that Oi Gem Quong was only 15 years old, in contrast to the 42-year old Lee, and a legal suit followed. By all accounts, Ms. Quong was excited to marry Mr. Lee and had her parents’ permission — but more than that, Ms. Quong maintained that she was not truly 15. In traditional Chinese culture, children are one at birth, in contrast to Americans who are zero. Accordingly, her lawyer argued that Oi Gem Quong was indeed 16 and able to consent to the marriage. They won.</p>
  
  <p>A lavish wedding followed, with events in both Lowell and Boston attended by family, friends and local businesspeople, as well as a state Senator. The Lees settled above their Camp Street laundry, and lived there for some time. The family had at least two children, and in 1945, Ah Jin Lee posted a notice that he would be closing down the laundry after 40 years due to his health.</p>
