  <h1 class="h2">Catalpa Road: A Residential Neighborhood by Gilbane Construction Company</h1>

  <p class="lede">With the extension of the streetcar system to areas further away from the city center, vast tracts of land on what was then the outskirts of Providence began to be developed at a rapid pace in the last quarter of the 19th century. It was after the 1886 extension of the streetcar line along Camp Street, that demand began to rise for the creation of housing in this neighborhood for the growing middle class of Providence.</p>

  <p>Prior to the wave of development further away from the center of Providence, the Gilbane family began their business in construction. William Gilbane started his business in 1870. He was trained as a carpenter, soon joined by his brother Thomas in 1873. The brothers opened a woodworking shop, where they carved and built all interior elements including windows, trim, and staircases. As their business expanded, the brothers began to work with some of the most prolific architects in the city on projects across many neighborhoods.</p>
  
  <p>By 1900, the Gilbane firm was commissioned to construct the new <b>Holy Name Church</b> on Camp Street in the Mount Hope neighborhood of Providence; the brothers constructed their own residences nearby at the intersection of Hope Street and Doyle Avenue. It was at this time that the brothers acquired the tract of land between Hope, Camp, Cypress, and Larch Streets. Working with city officials, Catalpa Road was established in 1902. It was graded in 1903.</p>
  
  <p>William and Thomas Gilbane became aware of the housing market and its needs, possibly working with Edward Irving Drowne, a successful real estate broker who was considered to be pivotal to this era’s development of residential districts across Providence. Though there was demand for new modern housing, the city was slow to adapt in the way of building and zoning codes. Gilbane used this to their advantage and subdivided the property along newly created Catalpa Road into eleven building lots.</p>
  
  <p>Working with the architectural firm of <b>Murphy & Hindle</b>, consisting of Ambrose J. Murphy and Franklin R. Hindle, Gilbane received two simple floor plans and basic sketches of the exteriors for the houses on Catalpa Road. Their talented crew went to work constructing the houses, all single-family residences with ten to eleven rooms in total, with fine woodwork, modern plumbing and electricity, and approximately 3,000 square feet of space. Much of the carpentry work was done by the carpenter Iver Johnson, an immigrant from Sweden who worked for Gilbane for many years. What differentiated this development from other land subdivisions was that the houses were constructed speculatively. Most land brokers at the time sold undeveloped subdivided lots, some with land restrictions or easements. On Catalpa Road, the houses were designed with similar layouts, but each had slightly different exterior features.</p>
  
  <p>This approach proved to be a success and has continued to be a part of Gilbane’s development practice to the present day. The company has taken what it has learned on Catalpa Road and utilized it in two modern-day developments in Wickford, Rhode Island and Anacortes, Washington. Both projects involved modestly scaled housing, utilizing basic sets of floor plans with varying elevation options, in line with the principles of New Urbanism.</p>
