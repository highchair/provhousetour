  <h1 class="h2">A Message from the Mayor</h1>
  <p class="lead">Congratulations to the Providence Preservation Society on your 42nd Festival of Historic Houses!</p>
  <p>I’m excited that this summer’s festival will highlight the architecture in our beautiful Mount Hope neighborhood, whose grand homes, tree-lined streets and historic ambiance illustrate what makes Providence such a vibrant city.</p>
  <p>I encourage each of you to take advantage of this opportunity to explore Mount Hope’s residences and get an up-close look at the fine workmanship and rich history behind one of Providence’s most renowned neighborhoods.</p>
  <p>Thank you to the Providence Preservation Society for your commitment to celebrating Providence’s legacy as a living museum of American history and architecture, making our city a world-class cultural destination.</p>
  <p><i>Sincerely,</i><br>

  <h2>A Message from our Executive Director</h2>
  <p class="lead">Welcome to the 42nd Festival of Historic Houses!</p>
  <p>Only two years after its founding, Providence Preservation Society (<span class="abbr">PPS</span>) held its first “street festival” in May of 1958 in Fox Point as a way to celebrate Providence’s historic architecture and inspire community members to join the preservation movement. That spring, 19 homes on John, Williams and Arnold Streets were open to the public and according to PPS’s newsletter, an astounding 1,200 people attended despite the “inclement weather.”</p>
  <p>Since then, <span class="abbr">PPS</span> has organized a regular Festival of Historic Houses in neighborhoods across the city. Recent Festivals have been held in Elmwood and Paterson Park, and this year we are excited to showcase the homes and gardens of the Mount Hope neighborhood. In 2015, the Festival was back where it started, along John, Williams and Arnold. I opened my own home for the event, hurriedly cleaning up our kids’ soccer cleats and backpacks and the dog’s treat bowls as we rushed out the door to make the first floor presentable (if you have ever opened your own home for this event, I see you and thank you!).</p>
  <p>As I write this, I hope that the weather on June 8 is not inclement — and I hope that you enjoy this opportunity to explore the particularly rich architectural and social histories of the Mount Hope neighborhood, and that you were able to attend the public programs associated with the Festival on public art and Black life in Mount Hope, and the history of the Catalpa Road development.</p>
  <p>Events like this are part of what makes living in and visiting Providence so unique: this is a special city, loaded with history, beauty, and a rare sense of connection and community. If you are not yet a <span class="abbr">PPS</span> member, please join us today (go to <a href="//pvdpreservation.org/membership" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">pvdpreservation.org/membership</a> for more information). We would love to have you be part of our community.</p>
  <p>I will be out and about today and hope to run into you in the neighborhood!</p>
